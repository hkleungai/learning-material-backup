            In this programming assignment, you are going to familiarize yourself with the concepts of inheritance and
            polymorphism.
            You will have the opportunity to implement a toy version of two digital signature algorithms (
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Signature_Algorithm">DSA</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature">Schnorr</a>).
            If you have taken COMP 2711 (or and Discrete Structures course) before, you should be familiar with the RSA
            Public Key Encryption scheme.
            In fact, there is a RSA-based digital signature. In this assignment, we omit RSA signature for simplicity.

            </p>
            <p>
              Before you work on this assignment, you can take a look at a short introduction of the digital signature
              below,
              and please also make sure you <b>read the description part</b> to get familiar with the relationship
              between different classes.
              Besides, you should read <a href="./files/digital-signature-algorithm-v3.pdf">Digital Signatures
                protocol</a>
              for the full specification of the functions you are to implement.
            </p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Digital Signatures</h3>
            <p class="card-text">
            <p>
              Digital Signature Algorithms are being used to verify if a message originates from a certain person. Let's
              assume that you're Alice, and you're sending your friend Bob a message to tell how much you love him, and
              you wrote to him the following letter:
              <center>
                <quote>"Dear Bob, I love you. Best, Alice"</quote>
              </center>
            </p>

            <p>But we also know that there's a third person, Eve, that knows you love Bob, and is also planning to send
              a message to Bob with the exact same message as a joke. Eve doesn't have to wait until you are sure you
              love Bob and you're sure you want to send the message. How can you prove to Bob that it's actually you
              that sent the message?</p>

            <p>For this, there are multiple digital signature algorithms option available, but all of them work in a
              similar way:<br /><br />
              Step 0: You have a public key and a private key.<br />
              Step 1: You "sign" your message using your private key.<br />
              Step 2: You send your signature and your message to Bob.<br />
              Step 2.5: You announce to everyone in the class your public key.<br />
              Step 3: Bob, using your public key, verifies that the message originates from you.<br /><br />
              Due to the cryptographic primitives, it is impossible for Eve to create a fake signature and imitate you,
              even if you release your public key to everyone, as long as you keep your private key to yourself.
            </p>

            <h3 class="card-title">Digital Signature Process</h3>
            <p>The digram belows explains the digit signature process</p>
            <p><img src="https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/security-digital_signature_process-f.png"
                width="100%"></img></p>

            <p>In our example, the sender, Alice, creates a digital signature using a private key to encrypt the
              signature.
              At the same time, hash data is created and encrypted.</p>
            <p> The recipient, Bob, uses the signer's public key to decrypt the signature to verify that the
              document's sender is indeed Alice and the message was not alter after it was signed.</p>
            <p>In summary, the processes include:
            <ol>
              <li>Generate keys</li>
              <li>Sign</li>
              <li>Verify</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Schnorr Algorithm and Digital Signature Algorithm are two algorithms for the digital signature process.
              You can find the details for the 3 processes of the 2 algorithms in this PDF file:
              <a href="./files/digital-signature-algorithm-v3.pdf">Digital Signatures protocol</a>.
              It gives the details of how the keys should be generated, how the signing and verification are done.

              some of the highlights:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do NOT try your "luck" - we use some sophisticated plagiarism detection software to find cheaters. It
                is much better than most students think. It has been proven times and times again tricks didn't work.
                We also review codes for potential cases manually.</li>
              <li>The penalty (for <b>BOTH</b> the copier and the copiee) is not just getting a zero in your assignment
                - it
                is much more than that. It is simply not worth to cheat at all. You would hurt your friend and yourself
                by doing that. It is obvious that a real friend won't ask you to get involved in a plagiarism act in
                any way due to the consequences. Read the Honor Code again before you even try to think about cheating.

              In this assignment, we implement toy versions of DSA digital signature and Schnorr digital signature.
              <!-- The signed signature of a message is modeled as the abstract base class <code>Signature</code>,
              which has two derived classes, <code>DSASignature</code> and <code>SchnorrSignature</code>.
              In order to create a signature on a message, a secret signing key is required.
              The secret key is modeled by the abstract base class <code>SecretKey</code>, which offers a
              <code>Sign()</code> function.
              Class <code>DSASecretKey</code> and class <code>SchnorrSecretKey</code> inherit the base class
              <code>SecretKey</code>.
              For each secret key, there is a corresponding public key to verify the signatures.
              This is modeled by the abstract class <code>PublicKey</code>. Similarly, it has two derived classes,
              <code>DSAPublicKey</code> and <code>SchnorrPublicKey</code>. They provide a <code>Verify()</code>
              function. -->
            </p>
            <p>

              There are 9 different classes given to you with the skeleton code:
            </p>
            <p>

              The signed signature of a message is modelled under the <code>Signature</code> class, which has two
              derived classes:
              (in signatures.cpp/.h)
            <ul>
              <li>Abstract base class <code>Signature</code></li>
              <li><code>DSASignature</code></li>
              <li><code>SchnorrSignature</code></li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
              These objects hold the actual signature.
            </p>
            <p>
              As discussed before, a user needs a secret signing key and a public key in order to be able to sign and
              verify messages respectively.
            <ul>
              <li> Abstract base class <code>SecretKey</code></li>
              <li> <code>DSASecretKey</code></li>
              <li> <code>SchnorrSecretKey</code></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <code>SecretKey</code> class provides the <code>Sign()</code> function necessary to create a signature
              on a message.
            <ul>
              <li> Abstract base class <code>PublicKey</code></li>
              <li> <code>DSAPublicKey</code></li>
              <li> <code>SchnorrPublicKey</code></li>
            </ul>
            <code>PublicKey</code> class provides the <code>Verify()</code> function necessary to verify a signature of
            a message.

            </p>
            <p>
              Note that some functions in the abstract base classes should be virtual.
            </p>

            <h4> Number Class </h4>
            <p>
              In DSA and Schnorr, the public/secret keys and signatures consist of integers of many bits (1024 or 256).
              They cannot be represented using common integer types such as <code>int64</code> (signed integer type with
              width of exactly 64 bits).
              <a href="https://gmplib.org">GMP Library</a> offers arbitrary precision numbers, but is difficult to
              install on Windows.
              Therefore we use <code>int64</code> to represent all numbers and cut down the bits of public/secret keys
              and signatures.

            </p>

            <p>
              We implement all necessary operations and functions of number in the class <code>Number</code>, in
              <code>number.h/number.cpp</code>. These functions and parameters of p, q, g are static
              functions/variables.
              Please check self-study notes in course website on static functions if you are not familiar with its
              usage.
            <ul>
              <li><code>Number::Add(n1, n2)</code>: integer addition. Return a <code>Number</code> that holds the sum of
                n1 and n2. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Sub(n1, n2)</code>: integer subtraction. Return a <code>Number</code> that holds the
                difference
                of n1 and n2. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Neg(n)</code>: integer negation. Return a <code>Number</code> that holds the negation of
                n. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Mul(n1, n2)</code>: integer multiplication. Be cautious about integer overflow.
                Return a <code>Number</code> that holds the product of n1 and n2. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Mod(n, p)</code>: integer modulo. Returns a <code>Number</code> that holds the integer
                <span style="font-family:'Georgia'; font-size: large;"><i>n</i> mod <i>p</i></span>. Almost every
                operation in this assignment is modular operation.
                Please use this to get correct results and avoid integer overflow. If you don't know what is integer
                overflow, please check

              </li>
              <li><code>Number::MulMod(n1, n2, p)</code>: apply modulo operation after multiplication. </li>

              <li><code>Number::Pow(base, exp, mod)</code>: Return a <code>Number</code> that holds the integer (base to
                the power of exp) modular mod. Notice that the exponent should be a non-negative number. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Inv(n, mod)</code>: modulo inverse (mod should be a prime number). Return a
                <code>Number</code>
                that holds the unique integer <span
                  style="font-family:'Georgia'; font-size: large;"><i>n</i><sup>-1</sup></span> such that <span
                  style="font-family:'Georgia'; font-size: large;"><i>n</i> × <i>n</i><sup>-1</sup> = </span> <span
                  style="font-family:'Cambria'; font-size: large;">1</span><span
                  style="font-family:'Georgia'; font-size: large;"> mod <i>mod</i></span>.
              </li>
              <li><code>Number::Rand(lower, upper)</code>: Return a <code>Number</code> that holds a random value in
                {lower, lower+1, ..., upper-1}.
                This used to generate keys and create signatures.
              </li>
              <li><code>Number::NSign(n)</code>: If n > 0, return 1. If n=0, return 0. If n < 0, return -1. Use this
                  function to compare two Numbers. </li>
              <li><code>Number::Hash()</code>Return the first 16 bits of SHA256 cryptographic hash function applied on
                the input.
                The input can be <code>std::string</code>, or <code>Number</code>, or
                <code>(Number, std::string)</code>. In the last case, <code>Hash(Number, std::string)</code>,
                the input is the concatenation of the bits of <code>Number</code> and the bits of
                <code>std::string</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              In <code>gmp_number.h/gmp_number.cpp</code>, the Number class is implemented based on GMP library, thus
              providing complete DSA/Schnorr algorithms.
              You can install GMP yourself and change the codes/filenames to experiment with gmp number, but <b>do not
                use GMP in your submission</b>.
            </p>


            <h4>Users and Admins</h4>
            <p>
              You don't need to read into <code>user.h/user.cpp/admin.h/admin.cpp</code> to complete the assignment.
              STL is used in class <code>User</code> and <code>Admin</code>, you are not required to write STL
              operations yourself.
              Knowing the usage of STL might help you understand the whole program. If might also help you debug.
              You can check the vector of STL in self-study notes on website. If you want to know more, you can search
              online for any tutorial or document.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each <code>User</code> has a name, a pair of DSA public/secret keys and a pair of Schnorr public/secret
              keys.
              A <code>User</code> can create a signature for a message and send both the message and the signature to
              another <code>User</code> by calling <code>SendMessage()</code> function.
              The <code>Admin</code> delivers the message to the other <code>User</code>. The
              <code>ReceiveMessage()</code> function of the other <code>User</code>
              is called to verify the signature.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>Admin</code> holds the public information of all users: username, pointer to <code>User</code>
              object, DSA/Schnorr public keys.
              The admin acts as both communication network and Certificate Authority (CA).

              some undefined-behavior-related bugs may also be detected.
              Note that if your program has no errors detected by the sanitizers, then the "Errors" tab may not appear.

            <p>As a hint, you can simulate the hidden test cases by writing test codes your self.
              For example, you can write codes to create an arbitrarily wrong signature and see whether
              your Verify can always return the correct results.

            Submit the <code>pa2.zip</code> to <a href="http://zinc.cse.ust.hk">ZINC</a>.
            ZINC usage instructions can be found <a href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk/guide">here</a>.</p>

            </p>
            <p><strong>The filenames have to be exactly the same</strong>.
              It must be a zip file, not rar, not 7z, not tar, not gz, etc.
              Inside the zip file, the cpp files need to have correct names.
              If your submissions cannot be uncompressed, they will not be graded.
            </p>
            <p>Make sure your source files can be successfully compiled.If we cannot even compile your source file,
              your work will not be
              graded, and you will get zero mark for your PA2. Therefore,
              you should at least put in dummy implementations to the parts that you cannot finish so that there will
              be no compilation error.</p>

            <p>
              <b>Make sure you actually upload the
                correct version of your source files - we only grade what you upload</b>. Some students in the past
              submitted an empty file or a wrong file or an exe file which is worth zero mark. So <b> you must
                download
                and double-check the file you have submitted</b>. You may refer to the illustration below.

            </p>

            <p>You may submit your file multiple times, but only the last version will be graded.</p>

                <p>Q: How to create a correct zip file for PA2?</p>
                <p>A: In an empty folder, create a "src" folder and an "include" folder. Copy the signatures.h to
                  "include" folder and the signatures.cpp to "src" folder.
                  Then select these two folders and compress. </p>

                <p>A:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Try to add more users, and send more messages.
                    See whether the cout output is expected. Make sure the range of output is correct.
                    The verification results are correct.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Test verify() function. Generate a invalid signature by giving
                    two arbitrary numbers to signature constructor.
                    It is very very likely (probability ~ 1-1/q) that Verify() should return false.

This is a bug and is now patched in the newer skeleton code. <br>
        To clarify that the number of <code>enemy_kill</code> and <code>money_earned</code> increase by one when an enemy change its state from NORMAL or FROZEN to DEAD after the attack of a tower. When a DEAD enemy is attacked by any type of tower, these two number should not be increased.
                </p>
    <p>
      <b>Q2: What does <code>Arena::getConstObjects</code> do?</b>
      <br>
      <b>A2:</b> This function should return the array of const Object pointers. The size of the array should be the same as the number of object in the Arena and the const pointers should be pointing to the Towers and Enemies in the Arena. Please refer the usage in <code>View::renderArena() </code> to get a proper idea of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>Q3: A tower would not be destroyed if it is placed in the left most. Bug? </b>
    <br>
    <b>A3:</b>It is undefined that if an enemy appear on a tower can destory a tower. We would not test this case in the grading.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q4:My program crash immediately when I run the program. Help please</b>
    <br>
    <b>A4:</b>You might want to check <code>Arena::getConstObjects</code> and <code>Arena::getObjectAt</code>. For more information, look at <code>View::renderArena</code> and <code>View::renderRange</code> on how these functions are called.

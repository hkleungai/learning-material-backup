      <TD>Are acceptance tests just sentences that restate the system requirements

      <TD>The restatement of the requirements <B>is not </B> the acceptance tests.
        The restatement is useful for writing the acceptance tests. After you have
        restated the requirements in point form, then you need to decide which
        of them are actually testable (i.e., can become acceptance tests) and then
        you need to further devise test cases that will demonstrate that the requirements
        are implemented correctly.</TD>

      <TD>It is suggested that we do a restatement of the requirements when we

        restatement?</TD>

      <TD><p>It is <b>not</b> necessary for you to hand in the requirements restatement
        that you do to derive the acceptance test cases. The requirements restatement
        for deriving the acceptance test cases are just the means to the end,
        which is deriving the acceptance test cases.</p></TD>

      <TD>Yes, there is a grade (between 5-10%) for the usability of the user interface
        of your system that will be included in the  Final Acceptance Testing grade. The specific grade will be decided
        by the person evaluating your system (i.e., it is based on a subjective

      <TD><P>You need to write test cases that will be used to test another team's
        implementation. The test cases should show that the system works as specified.
        One way to show this is to construct scenarios of how the system will
        be used and to demonstrate to the customer through these scenarios that
        the system works as specified. The scenarios basically come from the
        use cases, but you need to specify a step-by-step test that the tester
        can follow in using the system to do them.</P></TD>

      <TD>During peer acceptance testing, can the tester alter the database or

      <TD>The tester <strong>cannot</strong> directly alter the database or the
        computer's system time to perform a test case. All testing must be done
        through the user interface of the website. Clicking on previous, next
        or refresh is allowed as this is a function of the browser. Going to a
        third party website or directly to a link of the website being tested

      <TD>Can a team construct a test case that does not do anything except wait

        before the result can be checked, then the test case for this should
        be constructed in such a way that other test cases can be carried out

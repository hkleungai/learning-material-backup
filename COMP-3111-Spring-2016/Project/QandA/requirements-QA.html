Thus, when a     client places a buy order, he/she must have a "free" cash balance      sufficient to complete the order. The system should not     allow a client to place buy orders whose total monetary value is     greater than the client's  "free" cash balance at the time that     the order is placed. We note that this could     result in a client having a negative balance if the total monetary     amount of buy orders happens to be larger than what was anticipated     when the orders were placed. This situation is acceptable since the     overall value of a client's account (i.e., "free" cash balance plus     total monetary value of all securities held) should always be     greater than zero in the normal case.</td>

      <br>
      You need to provide currency conversion for all the       reports in requirement 6 that deal with a client's security       holdings that show total monetary value, namely, reports 6(a) and       6(b). It is <u>not</u> required for security searching (requirement 3).</td>

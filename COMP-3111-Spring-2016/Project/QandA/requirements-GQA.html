        assumptions about requirements that are not stated in the problem
        statement. However, there
        are requirements stated in the Q&amp;A  that contradict
        our assumptions. Do we need to follow the Q&amp;A requirements or continue

      <TD><P>In any software development, you should do what the client wants,

        <P>By the way, if you are frustrated about this issue,
          welcome to the real world! You will get clients/users
          changing their minds and clarifying requirements all the

          it effectively. You also need to check any assumptions you
          make with the client. If you do not, you are very
          likely to build a system the client does not want and what
      good is that?</P></TD>

      <TD>I have some difficulties in understanding what domain model we need to
        construct for the System Requirements Specification. I have read a book about domain modeling. It mentions
        that the domain model is a visual representation of the conceptual classes
        or real-world objects in a domain. It is a conceptual model and it says
        that responsibilities or methods of a class are not suitable in a domain
        model. Moreover, in the class examples (ASU: domain model and Video Sales:
        domain model), we also do not need to include any operations in the domain
        model. 
        As a result, I am confused about what we need to do  for the System Requirements Specification because
        I think that the domain model required is not the conceptual one and is
        different from what we learned in class. </TD>
    </TR>
    <TR>
      <TD VALIGN=top WIDTH=15><P><B>A:</B></P></TD>
      <TD><P>First of all, a domain model <B>is</B> represented visually by a class
        diagram. Different books may use the term domain model to mean different
        things, but this is what it means in this course. Second, the domain
        model that you construct for the System Requirements Specification is <B>exactly</B> the
        same type of model as the domain model for the ASU and Video Sales
        examples. It is basically the conceptual design of the database for
        your system. Finally, 
        the domain model classes usually only have operations to <i>get</i> and <i>set</i> the
        values of the attributes. There is no need to show these operations
        as it is assumed that every attribute in a domain model class has such
        operations. Therefore, showing them just clutters the class diagram needlessly.</P>

        While we know that some books do so, we believe that this is a <b>bad</b> specification
        technique since it closely ties the use-case (functionality) to the
        UI. Use-case descriptions should not refer to mouse clicks or dropdown
        lists or other UI implementation techniques since, if the UI implementation
        changes, then you also need to update the use-case descriptions. On the
        other hand, if a use-case description is kept independent of the UI (as
        the lecture notes state it should be), then you can change the UI without
        having to update the use-case description provided that the functionality
        of the use case has not changed.</P></TD>

        cases. If they can do exactly the same thing, then the fact that there
        are two different actors that use this use case should not affect how you
        write the flow of events. If there are some parts of the flow of events
        that are actor specific, then you can say something like: &quot;If the
        actor is X then ...&quot;. Such actor-specific parts in a flow of events

        an actor specific test in the use case to determine if that functionality
        should be executed as described in the previous question. There is obviously
        a design trade-off here. If a use case has too many actor specific parts,

        can obscure the basic flow so that it is not obvious or easily understandable.
        Thus, extensive use of if-statements to show alternative flows is not

          of what they can do using the system. An example of a
          nonfunctional requirement might be that the system (or a

          language. From the users' perspective this makes no
          difference to the functionality provided by the system, but
          it places a constraint on the implementation of the system. Please see

<!-- We have captured lecture videos from previous semester of the materials in the first 4
set of lecture notes. You are required to finish watching the videos and reading the
corresponding lecture materials before attending this year's lectures as those materials
won't be repeated this year. Instead we will go through some programming examples
directly to illustrate how you may write simple C++ programs with the concepts you should have
acquired from the introductory programming courses you took in your first year. -->

In the first 2 weeks of classes, to avoid overemphasizing some of the basic concepts already taught in your first programming course, we will cover the basics and control sections focusing mostly on C++ examples. The videos of an earlier year with a slower paced introduction covering this material will also be made available and may be referenced by the instructors for further emphasis on some topics. Students who have more limited programming experience or prefer a slower paced introduction of the basic programming concepts again are encoraged to also see these videos.

</br>
You may find the videos on the COMP2011 <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk">Canvas page</a> when it is ready.

Only if you can't access Canvas, then use the following CSE link to view the
lecture video:  http://2011video.cse.ust.hk/videos/list.html. The link
represents a temporary server which is <strong>not</strong> dedicated for
hosting video watching and may not be able to serve many simultaneous
viewers. Again, please only use it if you have no access to Canvas.

<p>
Though it is not written as a rule, because you signed up for this honor-track course, 
you are expected to work ahead of lab schedule (e.g. 2 weeks in advance) to learn
the material well in advance, especially if you are not familiar with QT.  This will
help you to equip with the basic skillsets to complete the projects which are larger
compared with those in COMP1004. 

<p>

<p>
On the other hand, because the lab assignments are very straightforward,
you may finish it within 3 weeks in a batch, and demo it once
and for all. <i>The batch mode is entirely an option. </i>
If you pick this mode (which you may not), then,
<ol>

<li> Do all the lab assignments. <font size=-2> (Note: We do not expect students to ask
many questions if they opt for the batch mode. If a student has
difficulty working on his/her own, s/he should attend the lab each
week.) </font>
<li>Zip your source codes
(.cpp and .h) and makefile into a single zip file called <b>lab.zip</b>.
<li>Upload the zipfile via CASS on or before <b>Mar 4, 2013</b>.
<i>Warning: If your submitted lab fails to compile,
your lab will be zero (as no late policy applies to labs). </i>
<li> Then, send an email to <a href="mailto:yxiaoab@cs.ust.hk">yxiaoab@cs</a>
to notify the TA that you have submitted your lab in batch mode.  <b>The email 
must be sent on or before the above deadline.</b>
<li>An appointment will be made with you to demo your labs. The demo will
last for 45minutes, where you have to convince the TA that you have
thorough understanding of the lab assignments (and therefore we use it
to verify if students copy labs from each other).

</ol>

        After Feb 28, no batch mode will be accepted (this means you have to attend
        and demo your labs to your TA to earn the credits). 

<P>
        If you pick the batch mode, and are successful in demonstrating
        that your labs satisfy all requirements as specified, you <b>score the
        lab in full and may skip all the comp2012h labs for the entire spring 
        semester!</b> Before you do, though, you need to attend the labs to
	  score the lab assignment.

<!---P>        Yet, if you are
        interested in programming, you may consider to still come to
	your assigned lab session and work on the ACM programming problem sets
	assigned by your TA in each week. 
        Some details are <a href=http://course.cs.ust.hk/comp2012h/S06/labs/index.html#acm>here</a---->.

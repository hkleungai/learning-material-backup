      <P>Written assignemtnts are short exercises given on a weekly (or biweekly) basis after the midterm exam, and these exercises are selected from the Weiss' book. The midterm and final are <I>closed book</I>.
Skipping the final examination without prior approval
will automatically lead to an "F" grade for the course.</P>

<!-----H3>Diagnostic Test</H3>
Students who do not satisfy ALL the following conditions
<br>

<DD> 1. CGA/SGA is at least A-
<DD> 2. easy104 is at least A- (preferably at least A)
<DD> 3. comp170 is at least B+ (preferably at least A-)

<br>
are normally not approved to take CS 2012h. They are recommended
to take COMP152 instead in order to avoid failing 152H.

<p>
Students who satisfy <b>at lease one</b> of the above but appeal 
to take this honor track course are invited to take the diagnostic 
test to demonstrate their potential. The test consists of completing 
and demonstrating to the TA <i>lab01 - lab07</i> before 5pm, 
<i>Feb 13, 2007</i>. This is similar to 
<a href=../labs/batch.html>batch mode</a> (see below). 

<p>
The TA will then email the course professor (cc to the student) 
letting all the parties know the recommendation. If the recommendation
is positive, the student must formally register 152H (and drop 151) 
before Feb 14, 2007 (last day of add/drop). Unfortunately, the student
need to handle any time clash with other courses. The CS department 
will offer as far as possible to resolve possible conflicts. If
time clash is a problem to you, you should contact the department <b>early</b> 
should you decide to take the diagnostic test. ----->

      <H3>Projects:</H3>CS 2012h is taught using the 
<A href="http://cssystem.cse.ust.hk/Facilities/hkust_only/labsetup/lab2.html">Lab 2 (4214)</A> 
consisting of roughly 40 Lenovo ThinkCenter M58 Intel C2D E8400 3.0GHz CPU (EM64T) machines, 
with Intel Q45 Chipset, 4GB RAM, 160GB Harddisk, and 17" LCD Color Monitors.
      The lab is open 24 hours (the only lab in UST that is open round the clock; use your 
student ID to access the lab) and can be reached by lift 19.

      <P>All programming assignments will be done individually except Project #2 where students can choose to work in pairs and submit one project. There will be five projects and their tentative are listed:
</P>
      <DL>

        <DT>Project #1: Paint (<b>Mar 8</b>) 
	<DD>A mini-version of the Microsoft Paint, completed with 
        a graphical user interface (GUI). 
        <DT>Project #2: Tetris (<b>Mar 28</b>): 
        <DD>An interactive 2D game, completed with a GUI.
        <DT>Project #3: Deques and randomized queues (<b>Arp 12</b>):  
        <DD>A data structure project on queue objects.
        <DT>Project #4: Pattern recognition (<b>Apr 26</b>):
        <DD>Line detection using brute-force and sorting. 
        <DT>Project #5: Course registration system (<b>May 16</b>): 
        <DD>A complex application based on linked-list objects. 
</DD></DL>For projects 1, 2, 5, you will have approximately three weeks 
for each project. Projects 3 and 4 are less involved and you will 
have one to two weeks for each of them.

<P>Your project will first be electronically tested for 
      cheating before grading to make sure that it 
      conforms to the "no-cheating" policy. Occasionally, you will be contacted
      by the TA to demo your project, who will then quiz you to determine 
      how well you understand the structure of the code, the design 
      trade-offs, and the implemented algorithms. 
      <!---attempt bells and whistles, which translate into (a bounded number of) 
      extra credit points.&nbsp; <A 
      href="optional.html">Click here</A> for more information on project grading. ---->
	<P>You may discuss the projects with your classmates, but only 
at the methodological level without going into details.&nbsp; 
Unless specified otherwise, you must do them all by yourself.&nbsp; Copying
the work of someone else in entirety or in part is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;
You will also be penalized if you show your work to others.&nbsp; Suspected
cheating and plagiarism will be referred to the University authorities
for investigation and appropriate disciplinary actions.&nbsp; (References:
<a href="http://www.ust.hk/vpaao/ug/APM/home.htm">Academic
Integrity and Discipline</a>, <a href="http://www.ab.ust.hk/ccss/Senate_Academic_Integrity.htm">A
Framework on Academic Integrity</a> and <a href="http://www.ust.hk/~webaa/con_classroom.ppt">Conduct
in the Classroom</a>).
<P>Students taking CS 2012h acknowledge that if sufficient evidence
are available indicating that they are involved in cheating in
projects, they are subject to the following penalties:
<ul>
<li> first-time offender: zero in project, minus one letter subgrade.
<li> second-time offender: F (no further discussion)
</ul>

      <H3>Projects Turn-in &amp; Late Policy:</H3>
      Projects are due at 23:59:00 on the due date. You are permitted a total of 
      <b>five late days without penalty</b> for the semester that may be used 
      on <i>any</i> of the five programming projects. After that, the grade 
      on the late projects are marked down at a rate of 33% per day, 
      meaning that if you fail to turn in an assignment on time it is 
      worth 66% for the first 24 hours after the deadline, 33% for the 
      next 24 hours, and it is worth nothing after that. 

      <P>Exceptions will be given only in extreme circumstances and only in
      advance. </P>

      <H3>Lab assignments:</H3>
Labs are taught in <A href="http://cssystem.cse.ust.hk/Facilities/hkust_only/labsetup/lab2.html">Lab 2 (4214)</A>. There will be 12 labs. Lab assignments are to be submitted and demoed to TA in each lab session. Alternatively you can choose to submit your labs once and for all in <a href="../labs/batch.html">batch mode</a>.

<!--You can either
<ul>
<li>attend each lab, and demo your lab to your TA. 
Lab assignment are due at the end of your lab session. No 
late lab assignment will be accepted; or
<li> do your labs in <a href=../labs/batch.html>batch mode</a>.

</ul>
Regardless of your choice, you may attempt <i>optional</i> programming 
problems prepared by TA in each week. Some details are 
 <a href=http://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012h/labs/index.html#acm>here</a>.
Successful completion of 
these tasks will be translated into a bounded number of 
extra credits. <A href="optional.html">Click here</A>

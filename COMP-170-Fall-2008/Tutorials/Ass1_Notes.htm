<h2><u>Comments on COMP 170 -- Fall 2008, Assignment 1</u></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Since this is the first assignment of the semester we are providing some 
extra clarification.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><font size="4">The assignments should be submitted by 5pm of the due 
	date in the assignment collection bin in 
	the corridor in front of room 4213A. Solutions will be available the day 
	after submissions are due, so late submissions will not be accepted.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Please submit a hardcopy of your assignment (emailed 
	solutions will not be accepted).<br>Either printed or handwritten hardcopies will be accepted.&nbsp; If writing 
	by hand,&nbsp; please do not write too small.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Keep a copy of your submitted solution around.&nbsp; If we can't find 
	your submission,&nbsp; we might ask you for the copy.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">Some of the questions require material NOT taught during 
	the first class that will be taught on Tuesday, 4 September.
	To get this material you can either read the last two 
	pages of section 1.1 in the textbook or check out the end of the Lecture 1 
	notes.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font size="4">The notation</font></li>

	previously seen this written as </font><font size="2">n</font><font size="4">C</font><font size="2">2</font><font size="4">.&nbsp; 
	Please <i><b>do not</b></i> use the </font><font size="2">n</font><font size="4">C</font><font size="2">2</font><font size="4"> 
	notation in any of your assignment answers.&nbsp; This is an older notation 
	which has been disappearing (we will see later in class why it sometimes has 
	some problems).</font></p>

	a short explanation as to how you derived the solution</i>&quot;.&nbsp; For

	<p align="left"><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Hint for Problem 5</font>. 
	Consider your&nbsp; solution to Problem 4.&nbsp; There are actually two 
	different ways to attempt&nbsp; to solve problem 4; the first corresponds to&nbsp; 
	first choosing the president and then choosing the executive board;&nbsp; 
	the second corresponds to first choosing the executive board and then 
	choosing the president.&nbsp; The two ways of thinking will lead to two 
	different formulas.&nbsp; But, since they describe the same thing, the two 
	formulas must be equal.&nbsp; Now try and relate this to Problem 5. </font></li>

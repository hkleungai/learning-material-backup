<h1>COMP2021 Lab5: Perl Programming II</h1>
<hr width="100%">
<h2>Lab Marks</h2>
<p>The mark for each lab is posted in this <a href="../../grades/score_lab.pdf">page</a>. If you have any
problems about the marks of the labs, please contact us as soon as possible. </p>

<h2>Tasks </h2>
<p style="text-align:center;color:red">Remember: You have to change the file permissions to run scripts!</p>
<ol>
    <li>Prime number counting: Find the prime numbers between 2 to the input number based on array. We need to create an array for storing all the prime numbers. At first we only have @primes = (2), then once we find another prime number, we push it into @primes and continue. Finally we print out all the prime numbers found as well as the total number of them. Input is sent through command argument.
        <a href="prime.pl">Ans:prime.pl</a><br>
        <b>Example:</b></br>
<pre>
$ prime.pl 10

2,3,5,7
We found 4 prime numbers in total.
</pre>
    </li>
    
    <li>Hangman Game: This is a word guess game. There are many words stored in array @words. Randomly choose one and store it in $choice. Then this Perl script will let you 
	guess the letters that belong to this $choice, one letter a time. You will fail the game if you make mistakes more than the length of $hangman (which is shown as a little man). 
	Try to execute <a href="hangman.pl">hangman.pl</a> to get some clues about how it works.

        <br><b>Example:</b></br>
<pre>
    $ hangman.pl
    --------

<li> Big & Small: In this task you will write a Perl program called <b><code>bigsmall.pl</code></b> to implement the game &quot;Big &amp; Small&quot; with the user playing against the computer. </p>
<h4>Game Rules</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Computer</strong> will throw 3 dices, each will have result from 1-6</li>
  <li>The <strong>User</strong> have to guess the results of the sum of the 3 dices, BIG or SMALL</li>
  <li>BIG means the sum of 3 dices are EQUAL or larger than 10. SMALL means the sum of 3 dices are EQUAL or smaller than 9.</li>
  <li>In the beginning of the game, the user will be asked how many money he has</li>
  <li>In each round, the user will be asked how much money he wants to bet on that round</li>
  <li>If the user wins the round, his current money = current money + bet money</li>
  <li>If the user loses the round, the current money = current money - bet money</li>
</ul>
<h4>Requirement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Users could choose to quit the game at each round</li>
  <li>If a user loses all his money, he will be forced to quit the game</li>
  <li>The program should also detect invalid inputs and prompt the user again for input</li>
  <li>For numeric inputs, you can assume the user won't input non-numeric characters</li>
  <li>The program must not allow the user to bet more money than he has</li>
  <li>When the user is leaving the game, display a list of gains and losses throughout the game, and the final amount the user gained or lost (look at the example below)</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to use a random number generator to make the computer's selection. The following lines will assign a pseudo-random value 1-6 into the variable <code>$rand</code>. You can then map these values to the dice throwing results.</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>$rand = int(rand(6)) + 1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For the function <code>rand()</code> to work, <em>you MUST execute another function at the <strong>beginning</strong> of the Perl program,</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>srand;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Allow the user to keep playing until they type <code>q</code> or he has no money. Example output should look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>$ <code>./bigsmall.pl</code> 
Big &amp; Small!
How much money do you have ?
<code>100</code>

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>b</code>
How much would you bet ? 
<code>10</code>
You bet $10 on Big

The Result is Big
You Win!
You now have $110

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>s</code>
How much would you bet ? 
<code>20</code>
You bet $20 on Small

The Result is Big
You Lose!
You now have $90

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>q</code>

Here is the list of gains and losses throughout your game:
+$100
+$10
-$20
-----
$90

You have finally lost $10! Goodbye!

$
</pre>
  <pre>
$ <code>./bigsmall.pl</code>
Big &amp; Small!
How much money do you have ?
<code>100</code>

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>b</code>
How much would you bet ? 
<code>100</code>
You bet $100 on Big

The Result is Small
You Lose!
You now have $0

You don't have any money, you must quit!

Here is the list of gains and losses throughout your game:
+$100
-$100
-----
$0

You have finally lost $100! Goodbye!

$
</pre>
  <pre>
$ <code>./bigsmall.pl</code>

Big &amp; Small!
How much money do you have ?
<code>50</code>

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>b</code>
How much would you bet ? 
<code>60</code>
You bet more than you have!
How much would you bet ? 
<code>10</code>
You bet $10 on Big

The Result is Big
You Win!
You now have $60

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit

............
</pre>
  <pre>
$ <code>./bigsmall.pl</code>

Big &amp; Small!
How much money do you have ?
<code>100</code>

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit 
<code>g</code>
Invalid Input

What would you guess ? (b)ig/(s)mall or (q)uit

    <h2>Marking Scheme</h2>


	<ol type="A">
		<li>Using Excel formulas to calculate the bullet path (30 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>Correct X (column A) values (5 marks)</li>
				<li>Correct Y (column B) formulas (10 marks)</li>
				<li>Correct Column (column C) formulas (5 marks)</li>
				<li>Correct Row (column D) formulas (10 marks)</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<li>The first macro - setting the target (30 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>The macro is triggered by <tt>Ctrl-Shift-T</tt> </li>
				<li>When the macro is triggered:</li>
				<ul>
				<li>First, the background colour of every cell in the worksheet is set to white (10 marks)</li>
				<li>Then the target cell is shown randomly, somewhere in the first 40 columns and the first 40 rows (10 marks)</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Make sure that the target cell is within the range <tt>A1:AN40</tt></li>
						<li>That's because <tt>AN</tt> is the 40<sup>th</sup> column</li>
				</ul>
				<li>A red background colour is used for the target cell (10 marks)</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The second macro - shooting the bullet (40 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>The macro is triggered by <tt>Ctrl-Shift-S</tt></li>
				<li> A random colour index ranging from 4 (Green) to 18 (Purple) is used (10 marks) </li>
				<li> In a loop, you should have the following:

					<ul>
						<li>Bullet row and column values are retrieved from the Calculations Worksheet, and the
						background colour of the appropriate cells are changed to show the path of the bullet (10 marks)</li>
						<li>The loop finishes early (using <i>Exit For</i>) if the bullet is too high or too low (10 marks)</li>
						<li>If the bullet hits the target, show <i>"Well done! You have hit the target!"</i> (or similar text)
						and then finish the loop (using <i>Exit For</i>) </i> (10 marks)</li>
					</ul>

				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
        <li>Enter your name and student ID number somewhere at/near the top of column D. In the lab, Cell <i>D1</i> is recommended
            <ul>
                <li>This is your statement that the work is yours</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
	</ol>

	<h2 name="late_policy" id="late_policy">Late Submission Policy</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>If you submit late, it causes us a lot of trouble, so please don't do that </li>
		<li>The submission link won't work after your lab deadline</li>
		<li>If you are late, you will have to send your work in an email to <strong>cspeter@cse.ust.hk</strong>
			with a suitable email title such as "COMP1022Q Late Lab Submission"</li>
		<li>Each lab project is given a mark out of 100</li>

		<li>At least 20 marks will be deducted if you submit late </li>
		<li>
			For every 12 hours (or part of that) you are late, 20 marks are deducted. For example,

			<ul>
				<li>If you are late for 1 second, 20 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>If you are late for 11 hours and 59 minutes, 20 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>If you are late for 12 hours and 1 minute, 40 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>and so on</li>
			</ul>

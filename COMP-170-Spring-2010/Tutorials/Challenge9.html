<p>This is the challenge problem to accompany Assignment 9.&nbsp; <br>Its solution should be submitted on or before May 13, 2010 with Assignment 9. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><font color="#FF0000">A line of 100 people are waiting to enter an airplane. They each hold a ticket for one of the 100 seats on the flight. (For convenience, assume that the&nbsp; <i>n<sup>th </sup></i>&nbsp; passenger in line has a ticket for seat number <i>n</i>, e.g., the first person has a ticket for seat number 1, etc.).</font></b></p><p><b><font color="#FF0000"><br>Unfortunately, the first person in line is crazy, will ignore the seat number on his ticket, and will pick a random seat out of the 100 to sit in. All of the other passengers are quite normal, though, and will go to their proper seat unless someone is already sitting in it. If someone is already sitting in their seat, they will choose an unoccupied seat at random and sit in it.</font></b></p><p><b><font color="#FF0000"><br>What is the probability that the last (100<sup>th</sup>) person will sit in his own (the 100<sup>th</sup>) seat?</font></b></p>

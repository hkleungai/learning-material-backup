        <h3> Course Overview </h3>

        <p>
          Discrete mathematics needed for the study of computer science: sets, functions; propositional logic, predicate logic, rules of inference, proof techniques; pigeonhole principle, permutations and combinations, binomial coefficients, inclusion-exclusion principle; probability theory, Bayes' theorem, expectation, variance, random variables, hashing; cryptography and modular arithmetic, Euclidâ€™s division theorem, multiplicative inverse, divisibility, RSA cryptosystem, Chinese remainder theorem; mathematical induction, strong induction and well-ordering property, recursion, recurrence relations; graph representation, isomorphism, connectivity, Euler and Hamiltonian paths, planarity, graph coloring.
        </p>

        <h3> Course Outcomes </h3>
        On successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:

        <ul>
          <li> Understand the formulation of common problems in several areas of discrete mathematics, including combinatorics, number theory and cryptography, logic and proof, recursion and recurrences and probability theory. </li>
          <li> Understand the connection between the discrete mathematical tools learned and some core computer science topics covered later in the curriculum, including computational complexity, information security, recursive functions and data structures. </li>
          <li> Apply the mathematical techniques learned to solve problems in a range of topics. </li>
          <li> Demonstrate a level of mathematical maturity by solving problems using an array of proof techniques. </li>
        </ul>

      <h3> Course Work </h3>

      <p>
        Course work will consist of 4 homework assignments and two exams (a midterm and a final). Homeworks are to be turned in by the <strong> start of class </strong> on the due date. Note that only a <strong> small </strong> number of the homework problems will be selected for grading purpose. <strong> No late homeworks will be accepted. </strong> In exceptional circumstances (illness, university business, or religious observances) extensions may be granted. However, all extensions must be approved by me <strong> before </strong> the due date.
      </p>

      <p>

        The primary benefit to working on homeworks is in preparation for the exams, because exam questions are often variants of homework problems. For this reason we encourage you to spend time alone thinking about each problem and your approach in solving it. You are allowed to and encouraged to discuss homework problems with your classmates. However, you must <strong> write up the solutions on your own. </strong> In particular:
        <ul>
          <li> Homework solutions must be written in your own words (not copied or modified from someone else's write-up). </li>
	  <li> At no time must you be in possession of another student's solution. </li>
	  <li> Do not access solutions made available in any previous semester. </li>
	  <li> Do not access solutions on other websites. </li>
          <li> You must understand your solution and its derivation. (We may ask you to explain your solution to us.) </li>
          <li> You must acknowledge your collaborators (whether or not they are classmates) or any other outside sources on each homework. </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        Failing to do any of these will be considered plagiarism, and may result in a failing grade in the course and notification for appropriate disciplinary action.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a courtesy to the graders, homeworks should be written neatly. Poorly written work will not be graded. When writing algorithms be sure not only that your solution is correct, but also that it is easy for the grader to understand why your solution is correct. Part of your grade will be based not only on correctness, but also on the <strong> clarity, simplicity, and elegance </strong> of your solution.
      </p>

        No make-ups will be given for midterm and final unless prior approval is granted by the instructor, or you are in unfavorable medical condition with physician's documentation on the day of the examination. In addition, being absent at the final examination results in automatic failure of the course according to university regulations, unless prior approval is obtained from the department head.

<LI>How the homework be graded?
<br><I>HW1 is worth 100 points total. The items will will look for are:
<br>Documentation:	20%
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Good program overview
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	Reasonable algorithm
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Comments for each var. declaration
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Comments for each code segment
<br>Indentation:  	10% 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	We want good, clear, and consistent indentation
<br>Output Formatting:	20%
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Make your output look like our example output
<br>Program Correctness: 50%	
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should continue when user types 'c' or 'C', and exit with anything else. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should give correct scores for different hands. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should report winner/draw correctly.
</I>
	

<br><br><LI>Will it worth less if I use a silly method, I mean using a lot of steps to finish the task.
<br><I>Very unlikely. As long your method does the job correctly, that is good enough for now. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>What's the meaning of "give detailed steps of your algorithm"?
<br><I>
We want about 10 or more steps in how you solve the problem. For example, "pick user cards" and "pick computer cards" are two steps. See our algorithms in the lecture notes for examples. Since we are expecting about 10 steps, that should give an idea of how much detail we want. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>What is the output if both of the computer score and player score are the same?
<br><I>
Report a "tie" or "draw" if they have the same score. For example,
<br>Computer's cards:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KH 7S 5H 7S   score: 1
<br>Player's cards:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JH 6S 2H JS   score: 1
<br>Tie
</I>

<br><br><LI>Is it okay to use some data structures (say, array, records,...) that you haven't taught us yet? 
<br><I>
No problem as long as the program works correctly. However, what we've covered so far is enough to do the assignemnt, so don't use the advanced stuff unless you feel very comfortable with it.  
</I>

<br><br><LI>If the player or the computer gets the hand of JC JC JC JC, what is the score of this hand? 
<br><I>
Give them the highest score that matches, in this example the score would be 5 (four-of-a-kind).
</I>

<br><br><LI>Should we type the documentation in the program? Or print it out to make a hard copy? 
<br><I>
Type the documentation (the overview and algorithm) at the top of your program. That way when you print out your program, you'll also print out your documentation automatically. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>Should we include in our documentation which test cases we have tried?
<br><I>
You don't need to document your test cases since the program picks the hands at random. However, you should run your program enough times to be confident it is correct. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>If I have AH AH 2H 3H, should I count the score as 4 or add the extra 1 because of the pair?
<br><I>
Give the hand a score of 4. No need to give them a bonus. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>In the original assignment 1 note, the due day said on the very beginning are different from the back. One said on 17/3 and one said on 19/3. Which one is the realy due day?
<br><I>
The due date is 17/3. That way the TAs will have enough time to grade the HW so to get it back to you before the midterm. 
</I>

<br><br><LI>What should be the file name in HW1?
<br><I>
Doesn't matter. hw1.cpp, draw.cpp, and assign1.cpp are all okay. 
</I>

Lab5

In this lab you will write a program that calls two functions in another 
simple card game. The goal of the game is to accumulate 4 of a kind or 4 
of the same suit (e.g., 4 kings or 4 clubs). 

For simplicity, assume each card is drawn one at a time, noted down, 
and then replaced before the next card is drawn. Initially, four cards 
are drawn. After that, the user selects one card to discard and a new 
card is drawn. Use pass-by-reference to call a supplied function drawcard(). 

Use the following card numbers and suits:

	 cardNumber:	cardType:		suit#:	suitType:
		1	Ace		1	H (hearts)
		2-10	2-10		2	D (diamonds)
		11	Jack		3	C (clubs)
		12	Queen		4	S (spades)
		13	King

Print the cards in the hand after each draw. Use the supplied printcard() 
function to do this. 

Count the number of draws needed before 4 of a kind/suit are held (not 
counting the initial four cards), and report it to the user. 

Here is a sample output:

	hand: 7H 6C 4H 7C 
	Which card to discard? 2
	hand: 7H 5H 4H 7C 
	Which card to discard? 4
	hand: 7H 5H 4H 3C 
	Which card to discard? 4
	hand: 7H 5H 4H 7H 
	4-of-a-kind/suit in 3 draws


Hint: Be careful what you discard, or you could be playing for a long time!

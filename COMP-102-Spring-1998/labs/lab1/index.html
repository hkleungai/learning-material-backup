COMP 102: Computer & Programming Fundamentals I
LAB 1

If you have trouble with any of the below steps, please raise your hand during the lab 
and the TA or lab helpers will help. 


1. Access the comp102 newgroup through the comp102 web page to see the latest postings.

2. Access the comp102 lecture notes through the comp102 web page, and print them out.

3. Follow the instructions in "Notes on using Visual C++" (on the comp102 web page under 
   "Lab Assignments") to start and run VC++ on the following short program:

	#include <iostream.h>
	main(){
		cout << "hello world!" << endl;
	}

   You can cut and paste the above program into a source file named "lab1.cpp" in VC++.

4. Save your source program lab1.cpp to a floppy disk. 

5. Try changing the output string "hello world!" to your own custom greeting. Also, delete 
   the semi-colon after the "endl" to see what error message appears when you compile the 
   program. Also, note how the output if different when you modify the cout statement to: 
	cout << "hello world!"; 

6. Demo your working program for your TA. This lab assignment will not be graded, 
   but future lab assignments will be graded.

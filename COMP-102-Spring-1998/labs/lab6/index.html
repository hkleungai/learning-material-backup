Lab 6 - HW2 Titanic Maze Game Part 1

Lab6 is a stepping stone for HW2. The task is to modify the 
given HW2 program to allow the user to set the level of difficulty (up to 3)
which determines the number of icebergs (so it is only the Titanic 
and multiple icebergs - no volcanic islands, no cargos, no score).
Also, only make icebergs visible when the Titanic is within two squares 
of them (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

The display shows a graphic representation of the Atlantic Ocean
--flat like a checkerboard.  The Titanic leaves England from the 
upper-right corner of the board, and must reach its destination 
New York, represented by the "N", in the lower-left corner. 
An iceberg, represented by the "I" moves around the ocean randomly, 
ever a threat to the Titanic. 

We have prepared an initial version of the program. In that version, 
the world looks like this: 

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|N| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

In every step, the user can press one of the keys l, r, u, or d to move 
the Titanic left, right, up, or down. For each move of the player, the 
iceberg  ("I") moves one square in a random direction. If the Titanic 
hits the iceberg, the player loses. If the Titanic gets to New York, 
the player wins. The user can also press x to exit the program.   

Your task is to modify the program to make the game more interesting. 
Make the following changes: 

1) Before the game begins let the user set the level of difficulty 
between 1 and 3. The difficulty level should be shown on the side of 
the screen during the game. 
2)  Add more icebergs, where the number of icebergs is equal to the 
level of difficulty.  
3)  Only make icebergs visible when the Titanic is within two squares 
of them (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). 

Rules of Movement: 
  If the Titanic tries to move off the edge of the board, 
  it hits land and sinks.
 Prevent the iceberg from moving off the edge of the board, 
  by picking a different random direction if this would happen. 
 Don't allow the iceberg to be placed on the New York square. 
 Don't allow the iceberg to be initially placed on the starting position of the Titanic. 
 Icebergs can occupy the same square with no effect. 

Keep a copy of lab6, since you can use it in HW2.

  </p>
   
<hr width="100%"> In this lab, you are going to simulate a forest plagued 
by a parasite.<br>
 <br>
 A parasite plagues a forest by infecting the trees and causing<br>
 them to defoliate (lose their leaves). Defoliated trees are removed from 
the forest and new trees are planted in their places, which in turn may become 
infected by the parasite. The following three rules define a simple model 
of the forest environment:<br>
 <br>
 1. An infected area becomes defoliated the following year;<br>
 2. A defoliated area becomes green the following year;<br>
 3. An infected area infects its neighbors to the north, south, east and
west the following year, if they are currently green.<br>
 <br>
 A biologist requires a computer program that will use the rules given above 
to simulate the <br>
 changes in the forest over a number of generations (one generation = one 
year). <br>
 The program should represent the state of the forest by a grid of 25 letters. 
For example, the state<br>
 <br>
 GGGGG<br>
 GGIGG<br>
 GGDDG<br>
 GGGGG<br>
 GGGGG<br>
 <br>
 indicates that most of the forest is green (G), with<br>
 only one infected area (I) and two defoliated areas (D). <br>
 The user of the program should be able to specify the initial state of the 
forest, and to enter the number of generations for which the simulation will 
run.<br>
 <br>
 There are two parts for this lab.<br>
 <br>
 Part 1. Design and implement necessary functions for the following<br>
 main() function to run properly:<br>
 <br>
 void main() {<br>
 &nbsp; char stateOfForest[5][5]; // the state of the forest array<br>
 &nbsp; int generation; // the number of generations to simulate the forest<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp; get_initial_state(stateOfForest); <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // get the initial state of the 
forest<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // from the user, and save it 
in stateOfForest<br>
 &nbsp; get_generation(generation); <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // get the number of generations 
to simulate from the user<br>
 &nbsp; for(int i=1; i&lt;= generation; i++) {<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print_state(stateOfForest); cout &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //print out the state at each generation - good for debugging 
your program<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; update_state(stateOfForest);&nbsp; //update the state 
using the three rules above<br>
 &nbsp; }<br>
 &nbsp; print_state(stateOfForest);<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // print out the final state<br>
 }<br>
 <br>
 Part 2. One problem with the simulation program above is that it runs<br>
 for a fixed number of generations regardless whether the state of<br>
 the forest is stable or not. For instance, if the initial state of<br>
 the forest is all green, then it stays that way for ever. Modify<br>
 the above simulation program so that it stops as soon as the state<br>
 becomes stable.<br>
 <br>
 You should submit the following files for evaluation:<br>
 <br>
 1. YourFirstName_YourLastName_Comp104_Lab6_Part1.cpp<br>
 <br>
 This file should contain only the main() function above, plus<br>
 appropriate #include and using directives. In particular, it should<br>
 include your header file for the lab (see below).<br>
 <br>
 2. YourFirstName_YourLastName_Comp104_Lab6_Part2.cpp<br>
 <br>
 This file should contain your modified main() function as required<br>
 in part 2 of the lab.<br>
 <br>
 3. YourFirstName_YourLastName_Comp104_Lab6_Forest.h<br>
 <br>
 This header file should contain the prototypes of all the functions that<br>
 you introduce and use in your C++ source codes for the lab, that is,<br>
 those functions that are not in the standard library but needed<br>
 in order to run your programs.<br>
 <br>
 4. YourFirstName_YourLastName_Comp104_Lab6_Forest.cpp<br>
 <br>
 This file should contain the implementations of the functions in<br>
 the above header file.<br>
 <br>
 For example, if your name is "Cindy Li", then you need to submit<br>
 the following four files:<br>
 Cindy_Li_Comp104_Lab6_Part1.cpp, Cindy_Li_Comp104_Lab6_Part2.cpp,<br>
 Cindy_Li_Comp104_Lab6_Forest.h, Cindy_Li_Comp104_Lab6_Forest.cpp.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Hints: This is not a hard problem, but it is easy to get a messy<br>
 program if you are not careful. So don't rush into writing the codes,<br>
 think about how to solve the problem in the cleanest possible way.<br>
 To see the difference between Part 1 and Part 2, try the following<br>
 initial state, and simulate it for 30 generations:<br>
 <br>
 GGIGD<br>
 GGGGG<br>
 GGGGG<br>
 GGGGG<br>
 GGGGG<br>

  <font face="Arial,Helvetica">Demo your working program for your TA. The 
TA will check your source code to make sure you made reasonable use of arrays 
and functions. If for some reason you cannot finish before the end of the 
lab period, email your program to your TA by <b>Sunday 30 October 5PM</b> 
(please include your name and lab section as a comment on line 1 of your program).</font>

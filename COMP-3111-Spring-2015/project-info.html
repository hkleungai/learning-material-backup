<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Large-scale software development projects require groups of designers, implementers and support staff. Because of this, these projects demand not only technical abilities, but also skills in group dynamics and communication. To give you some experience with all of these aspects of software development, you will work in three person groups to carry out the required project activities including requirement analysis, architecture, design, implementation, and documentation.
<p><i>The project will be developed in a team of four students. The team formation is a combination of voluntary teaming and random assignment. This means that for teams of insufficient members beyond Feb 17 is subject to random regrouping with the best effort to preserve the existing partnership. In case that the total number of students is not a multiple of four, teams of five will be established by random assigning additional members to the existing groups.  </i>

<p>The project will be developed using the Java programming language and the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse Java development toolkit</a>. These development tools will be introduced in lectures, labs, and tutorials. There are tutorial notes that describe the features and functionality of these development tools, which <font color="#cc3300"><i><b>you should read  <u>before</u> your lab and tutorial each week!</b> </i></font>Because the lab and tutorial time is limited, we can cover only some aspects of these development tools.  <font color="#cc3300"><i><b>Therefore, you will be expected to learn how to use these  development tools mainly on your own.</b></i></font></p>

<p>Your group may lose a member for various reasons. If this happens, you will be expected to close ranks and adjust to the problem. Loss or change of personnel does happen in the real world and is yet another reason for carefully documenting each step of a software development project.</p>

<p>Computer resources seem to be the scarcest and least available when needed most. This is also true in the real world. Servers may be heavily loaded or unavailable at critical times. <font color="#cc3300"><i><b>Do not leave working on a project activity until the last week, last few days or last few hours before a deadline.</b></i></font> If you do so, you are just asking for trouble.  <font color="#cc3300"><b><i><u>You have been warned!</u></i></b></font></p>

<h4>Project Organization</h4>
For the course project, you are given the source code of a skeleton package that only acts as a starting point for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the calendar system. The GUI contains the minimum necessary elements for which you can use as a design reference and are free to extend, to modify, and to create new ones, as long as your changes do not affect the testing of the <a href="ps.html">requirements of the project</a>.

<p>The project will be divided into two major phases: the single user memory-based appointment scheduling and the multi-user disk-based scheduling. The learning objectives of the two phases are described as follows.
<p><b>Phase one:</b><br>
<li> Learn to program in modern object oriented language such as Java using a fully featured integrated development environment (IDE).
<li> Learn to convert imprecise textual technical requirements to precise technical specifications.
<li> Learn to extend the given code base by adding new GUI elements and major new features.
<li> Learn to develop software as a controlled and monitored process through the use of version control.

<p><b>Phase two:</b><br>
<li> Learn to support the notion of persistence and data management.
<li> Learn to use unit testing and regression testing to maintain the quality of the software.
<li> Learn to articulate and document the design and architecture of software systems.

<p>The project consists of the following activities:
<ol>
<li> <b> Activity 0: Project Initiation, Organization and Management</b> During this activity, you are required to get familiar with the logistics of the project and, most importantly, <i>form a team of four and choose a cool name for your team.</i>  You are required to submit your team information to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hoZchvoQQB_KXDgg8gO8WNduZMH8xuex6js02keD3gM/edit?usp=sharing">online sheet</a> before Feb. 17th. Each team will be assigned a TA as the mentor.

<li> <b> Activity 1: Memory-based Single-user (Phase I) </b> During this activity, you are required to implement a memory-based storage for the calendar GUI to support the use of a single user. For this phase, you are required to implement only the features described in <a href="ps.html#1">Phase I specification </a>
    . The purpose is for you to get familiar with Java programming in Eclipse, the 
    calendar base code, and the version control system. You are required to apply 
    the tag your entire project as &quot;version 1&quot; upon the submission deadline. The 
    submission deadline is Apr 3.

<li> <b> Activity 2: Disk-based Multi-user (Phase II) </b> In this activity, you are required to implement a disk-based storage for the calendar GUI and to support the use of multiple users. For this phase, you are required to implement the features described in <a href="ps.html#2">Phase II specificaiton </a>. The purpose is to develop practical and slightly more sophisticated features emulating the practical usage scenarios. You are required to apply the tag your entire project as "version 2" upon the submission deadline. The submission deadline is May 8.

<li> <b> Activity 3: Design Documentation </b> Please refer to <a href="#doc">the following section</a> for details.

<a name="eval"></a>
<h4>Evaluation  </h4>
The assessment of the project Phase I and II is based on both functional correctness (80%) and the coding style (20%). The functional correctness is measured through two components: group assessment (70%) and individual assessment (30%). In the group assessment, you will be asked to demo your submitted program through a set of test cases. Each test case is a set of operational instructions, conducted by group members, with the expected output, verified by the TA. The group score is determined by the score sheet of the test cases. To assess the individual contribution, each team is required to submit a document describing the following:
<ol>
<li> Individual contribution percentage: each member of the team needs to specify his or her contribution to the milestone. I would expect each member will contribute 100% of her or his share of the work. Any case that has lower than 70% contribution will lead to a meeting with the TA or the instructor.
<li> Each group member will need to indicate which features of the calendar system that she or he has worked on. The feature must match one of the numbered requirements stated in the problem statement.
</ol>
This document will be used in the demo to evaluate the individual contribution by asking the responsible group member to answer code-level questions and to make small modifications of your code on the fly.

<p><b>Time machine.</b> Do not program directly using your computer clock because, for testing purposes, we will ask you to fast forward and rewind the clock that is used by the calendar system. During the evaluation of the project, the evaluator will use the interface you provide, either on the GUI or from the console, to use this time travelling feature and test the functionalities of the implementation. You must make sure your entire calendar system is based on a changable clock.
</p>
Please make note of the following:
<ol>
<li> You will need to self-educate with the most of the related material. Google is your best friend.
<li> You must discuss the design and the technical details in the architectural document to obtain the full mark.
<li> You are only required to implement these specifications in the final submission of your project.
</ol>
</ol>

<a name="problem statement"></a>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>The <a href="ps.html">project problem statement</a> details the high-level 
    requirements of the course project. Clarification of these requirements will be 
    given throughout the semester in response to emails. Please send your enquiries 
    to your Mentor.<hr>
<a name="code"></a>
<h4>Base Code</h4>
<p>The base code of the project is <a href="project/base.jar">available and downloadable</a>. You can directly import it as an Eclipse Java project and it should be compilable and runnable immediately. To import it as Java project using Eclipse, follow these menu actions: "File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select archive file". You should see the project "comp3111" and click "OK" to import it. The source code contains a sample and <b><i>very simple</i></b> implementation using the memory-based storage of the calendar data. Please read the source code and it also contains useful comments.
<hr>
<a name="doc"></a>
<h4>Architecture Document</h4>
For the system design document, you are required to write a design document that describes the use of design patterns in your project. You are required to identify the usages of two design patterns in the existing code and one <b>new</b> application of design patterns that can improve the existing design of your code. For the <b> new </b> application, you are not required to implement them in your code, since this is a design document.

For each of the three descriptions of patterns, you should follow the following sectioning guidelines:
<ol>
<li> <b>Name:</b> The name of the pattern.
<li> <b>Motivation:</b> What design problem, in the context of the calendar software, exists without the use of this particular pattern. You are encouraged to think in the context of real world usages that involve many users and a large amount of information.
<li> <b>Solution:</b>  How this pattern solves the problem for the calendar software in theory according to the real world usage.
<li> <b>Class diagram:</b> Give the class diagram in each description that shows the proper inheritance relationships of Calendar classes with respect to the general pattern classes, in the style consistent with the lecture notes. For instance, you should diagram the generic classes of Observer pattern, and show how your classes inherit from them. You are not required to show all fields and methods for the clarity of the diagram. You can just show the necessary fields and methods that are relevant to the implementation of the specific pattern.
</ol>

The requirement for the document is a A4/12 point font for no less than 3 pages. The document will be graded on the correctness and clarity of the presentation and the discussion.
<hr>
<h4>Bonus Competition (20% of the project mark)  </h4>
To encourage creativity and have fun, there is a bonus competition that each team can freely implement an unspecified feature that is <b> relevant</b> to the calendar application. To be clear, a feature means a new way for the end user to interact with the calendar system that is useful. This bonus feature will be evaluated by the teaching team at the end of the sememster. The top 3 teams will be rewarded the full project bonus (20%) and the next 3 teams will get half of the project bonus (10%). To enter the bonus competition, you will need to first inform your mentor and, most importantly, submit a README file to explain how your feature functions. Naturally, you will also need to indicate the team members' responsibilities. The bonus feature will be checked in the demo based on your README document.

<h2>The following the specified outcome for this course</h2>
<h3>Outcome of COMP3111</h3>
On successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
<ol>
<li>	Apply appropriate modeling techniques to design software for an application of medium complexity: model and document data and processing requirements for an application using a modeling language and implement a disciplined software design for an application.
<li>	Apply appropriate software engineering techniques to implement an application of medium complexity: transform requirements for an application, expressed in a modeling language, into a working software system, select appropriate algorithms to implement the stated requirements and design and implement a variety of tests to validate that a software system meets its stated requirements.
<li>	Function effectively as a member of a software development team: organize, manage and participate in a small software development team and plan and schedule the activities involved in developing the software for a medium-sized application.
</ol>

<hr>

<ol>
   <li><b>Instructional approach</b><br>
   The lectures will cover the basic textbook material. Lectures will not necessarily cover all of the indicated reading, so <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>do not skip the readings</i></b></font>. As a general principle, you will be responsible for the topics covered in lectures <i>and</i> for assigned sections of the textbook. <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>In this course, you will learn as much by doing (in the tutorials, labs and project) as by listening (in the lectures).</i></b></font> This will probably be the first time that you will  produce a <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>software product</i></b></font> rather than simply a program. The greatest challenge you will face, and the greatest benefit derived, will be from the <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>experience of working in a large group</i></b></font> and producing the required artifacts (i.e., documentation and code) according to a strict schedule.  Because you are expected to take a very active role in this course, <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>you must come to each lecture prepared</i></b></font>, which means reading the assigned chapters <i><u>before</u></i> the lecture and identifying questions that you need answered. Preparation also means <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>being willing to find the information that you need</i></b></font>, for example, in textbooks, on the Web, or in other resources.<br> <br>
   </li>

   <li><b>Expected work load.</b><br>
   This course will take up <u>quite a lot</u> of your time this semester. From previous experience, project-oriented software engineering courses are the <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>heaviest workload courses</i></b></font> in both graduate and undergraduate curricula. <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>However, good planning and time scheduling can greatly mitigate your workload.</i></b></font><i><br>
   <br>
  </i></li>

   <li><a href="lecture-notes.html"><b>Lecture notes</b></a><br>
   Lecture notes are available from the <a href="index-2.html">course home page</a>. <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>Lecture notes are outlines only of the lecture material</i></b></font><i>.</i> They are not a substitute for the textbook and should not be relied on solely for your knowledge of the course material. In particular, they are not a substitute for reading the indicated chapters in the textbook or for attending lectures.<br> <br> </li>

   <li><a href="project-info.html"><b>Project milestones out/due dates</b></a><b>.</b><br> The project milestone <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>due dates are firm</i></b></font> and will not be changed unless exceptional circumstances arise.<br>
   <br>
   </li>

   <li><a href="project-info.html"><b>Project</b></a><br>
   The course project is a group project broken down to required activities. The project description is available online. The instructor will form groups during the first week of lectures from students enrolled in the course. The instructor reserves the right to remove members from or to add members to any group at any time during the semester so as to more evenly balance the number of people in each group.<br> <br>
   </li>

   <li><a href="lab-tutorial-info.html"><b>Labs/Tutorials</b></a><br>
The tutorials  will be used to introduce you to various software tools that you will need to use to do the project (primarily, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse Java Platform</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.org/" target="_blank">MySQL Database Engine</a>). The labs will be used for practice exercises related to the tutorial material. <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>You need to successfully complete the lab assignment during the lab session to get tutorial and lab mark</i></b></font>. The labs and tutorials are also a time during which you can work with your group members on the project or consult with a TA about the project or other course material. <br><br>
   </li>

   <li><a href="http://www.ust.hk/vpaao/integrity/" target="_blank"><b>Academic conduct</b></a><b>.</b><br>
   Unless otherwise stated, <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>the work that you submit for grading must represent the result of independent effort</i></b></font> (individual for tests, group/team for the project). In particular, you are not allowed to give solutions to or to copy solutions from other individuals/groups. Suspected breaches of these rules will be referred to the relevant University authorities for disciplinary action. If in doubt, consult with an instructor or a TA first.<br>
   <br>
  </li>

   <li><b>Computer account security.</b><br>
    Remember, do not share your account with
   anyone and Protect your CSE account password!<br>
   <br>
   </li>

   <li><b>Classroom etiquette.</b><br>
   The following rules are for the benefit of all to ensure that the
   classroom environment is conducive to teaching and learning.

   <ul>
      <li>You are expected to <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>arrive on
      time for lectures</i></b></font> (as is the instructor
      <img src="policy_files/smile.html" height="13" width="13"
align="bottom">)
      and generally not to leave during the lecture unless an
      emergency arises. If you must leave during a lecture, please do
      so <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>as quietly as
      possible</i></b></font> with
      <font color="#cc3300"><b><i>minimum disruption to the
      class</i></b></font>.</li>

      <li><font color="#cc3300"><b><i><u>Talking is strictly
      prohibited during the lecture</u></i></b></font> unless you are
      asked a question by the instructor or directed to discuss
      something amongst yourselves. To behave otherwise shows
      disrespect, not only for the instructor, but more importantly
      for your fellow students.</li>
   </ul>

   <dl>
      <dt>Please be considerate in your behavior and consider the
      possible effects of your actions on others <i><u>before</u></i>
      acting.<br>
      <br>
      </dt>
   </dl>
   </li>

   <li><b>Information posted on the course web pages</b><br>
   Please note that the course web pages are constantly undergoing
   revision. No information on the course web pages is final until it
   has been announced in class.<br>
   </li>

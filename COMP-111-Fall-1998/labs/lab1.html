<LI>Send an email to your COMP 111 TA.
</OL>

<H3>Printing lecture notes</H3>

<P>You will be shown how to access the COMP111 lecture notes, and how to
print them.</P>

<P>Note that you have a fixed printing quota. When you run out of quota,
you cannot print any more pages! So it is a good idea to save paper by
printing two or four pages on every side of paper. To do this you need
to :</P>

<OL>
<LI>Using Netscape, save the file which contains the lecture notes to your
directory. </LI>

<LI>Use the <TT>mpage</TT> command to create a new file which has multiple
pages on each side (for example, <BR>
<TT>mpage -4 lecture.ps &gt; newfile.ps</TT> <BR>
will produce four pages on each side).</LI>

<LI>Optionally, you could use the program <I>ghostview </I>to look at the
new file. To do this, just type <BR>
<TT>ghostview newfile.ps</TT></LI>

<LI>Print this new file using <TT>lpr </TT>(for example,<TT> <BR>
lpr -Pcll3 newfile.ps <BR>
</TT>will send the new file to the printer).</LI>
</OL>

<P>
See the documents on
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cssystem/UG_reset.html">
schedule for quota reset</A> and

<OL>
<LI>Change your password from the one you have been given into a more sensible
one. </LI>

<LI>Create a file called &quot;lab1.txt&quot; with the following content:
</LI>

<PRE>pico is a simple text editor. 
The command &quot;ls&quot; lists directory contents and file attributes. 
The command &quot;cat&quot; concatenates and displays file contents. 
The command &quot;rm&quot; removes a file. 
The command &quot;cp&quot; copies source file(s) to target file(s). 
The command &quot;mv&quot; renames or moves a file. 
The command &quot;man&quot; displays reference manual pages by keyword. </PRE>

<LI>Copy the file &quot;lab1.txt&quot; to a file called &quot;lab1duplicate1.txt&quot;.
</LI>

<LI>Copy the file &quot;lab1.txt&quot; to a file called &quot;lab1duplicate2.txt&quot;.
</LI>

<LI>List the names of the files that you have in your home directory. </LI>

<LI>Delete all the lines in the file &quot;lab1duplicate1.txt&quot; except
the first one. <BR>
Similarly, delete all except the <I>last </I>line of the file &quot;lab1duplicate2.txt&quot;.
</LI>

<LI>What happens when you give the following command: <BR>
<BR>
cp lab1duplicate1.txt lab1.txt<BR>
<BR>
<I>Hint: Use the command &quot;man&quot; to know more about the command
&quot;cp&quot;. </I></LI>

<LI>What happens when you give the following command: <BR>
<BR>
mv lab1duplicate2.txt lab1.txt. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Hint: Use the command &quot;man&quot; to know more about the the command
&quot;mv&quot;. </I></LI>

<LI>Based on your observations, what is the difference between the commands

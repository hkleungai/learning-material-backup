There are two ways to pass a parameter to a function in C++: passing by value
and passing by reference. In short, if you pass a variable to a function by
value, the function can't change the content of the variable after the function
is finished but if the variable is passed by reference, it may be changed by
the function after the function is finished. <p>

The following teaching aid shows you what will exactly happen in the computer
when you pass parameter by value and by reference.  <p>

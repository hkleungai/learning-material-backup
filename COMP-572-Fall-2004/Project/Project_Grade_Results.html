<p>COMP572 -- Fall 2004</p>
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Project Grades</font></h2>
<p>The project grades are now available<a href="http://www.cs.ust.hk/~cszz/comp572grades.htm">here</a>. Please note the following</p><ol>	<li>Projects were graded on&nbsp; a scale of 0-100.&nbsp; <br>	Your final grade on the project is listed in the final column (<b><font color="#008000">Project</font></b>) 	of the table.</li>	<li>Team members on the same project received the same grades</li>	<li>30 points&nbsp; (<font color="#008000"><b>Proj Doc</b></font>) were 	given for documentation and program style; <br>	70 points (<font color="#008000"><b>Proj Prog</b></font>)&nbsp; for 	correctness</li>	<li>The 70 correctness points were awarded after running the programs on 	various standard test cases. Points were deducted for each test case on 	which the program did not give the proper answer. We then asked the authors 	of penalized programs to correct their code and reran them again on the test 	cases. Points were again deducted for all test cases yielding improper 	answers .&nbsp; We sent the still-penalized programs back for fixing a 2nd 	time.&nbsp; On return, all programs were working on all test cases so no 	more points were deducted.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 4 different possible projects.&nbsp; Projects 2-4&nbsp; come in 
different variations. Each project/variation indicates the maximum size of a 
group that can work on that project/variation. Click on individual projects for 
more details. All programs should be written using languages/packages that are 
&quot;normally&quot; available on either our department Windows or Solaris machines.&nbsp; 
When registering your project (see below),&nbsp; you should indicate what 
languages/packages you will be using. We will contact you if there is a problem.</p>

<p>If you have any questions concerning the project please send email to the TA 
at <a href="mailto:cszz@cs.ust.hk">cszz@cs.ust.hk</a> or me at
<a href="mailto:golin@cs.ust.hk">golin@cs.ust.hk</a>. Answers to questions of 
general interest will be posted on the&nbsp; <a href="FAQ.html">PROJECT FAQ</a></p>

<p>A list of who is registered for which project is maintained

<h2><u><font color="#0000FF">Important Deadlines</font></u></h2>

<ul>
  <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Monday, November 22, 2004</font><font size="4">.</font></b> 
  By this date you should email <a href="mailto:cszz@cs.ust.hk">cszz@cs.ust.hk</a>,&nbsp; 
  registering your project.&nbsp; You should tell him (i) which 
  project/variation you will be doing and (ii) the students in your group.&nbsp; 
  Your email should also (iii)&nbsp; indicate what languages/packages your code 
	will be written in (if you change your plans later, please send an update 
	email). Only one group member should send the email, with the message being cc'd to all 
  other group members. <br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Wednesday, Dec 8, 2004 at 1PM.&nbsp; </b>

  <ol>
    <li>Hard Copy should be submitted at box in dept admin office on&nbsp; Dec 
    8, 2004 before 12:45PM<br>
    Hard copy can also be given to instructor at last class on Dec 7, 2004</li>

  <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Wednesday-Friday, Dec 8-10, 2004: </font>
  </b>Individual group meetings to demonstrate project. <br>
  Originally we intended all groups to demo their projects.&nbsp; Since most 
  students are <b>not</b> writing GUIS we have decided to cancel the general GUI 
  requirement.&nbsp; Instead, only the small number of students/groups who are 
  writing GUIs need to demo.&nbsp; 

<ul>
  <li><b>Only read this if your project has a GUI</b></li>
  <li>If your project has a GUI you must DEMO it</li>
  <li>Demos will be Wednesday Dec 8, from 2-4:30PM in the instructor's office. 
  Demo slots will start on the quarter hour and last 15 minutes,&nbsp; e.g., 
  2PM, 2:15PM,...., 4PM, 4:15PM. </li>
	<li>A list of the currently scheduled and available project demo times is 
	available <a href="Demo_schedule.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>To reserve a demo time send email to <a href="mailto:golin@cs.ust.hk">
  golin@cs.ust.hk</a> before 1PM on Dec 6, 2004 with your first and second 
  choices of preferred demo time. You will receive confirmation of your demo 
  time before class on Dec 8, 2004.</li>

<h2><u><font color="#0000FF">Important Details</font></u></h2>

<p>In your submitted code, the part that implements the algorithm(s)&nbsp; must 
be fully and clearly documented so that the marker can read it and understand 
what each part of the algorithm is doing (and is able to map it to the 
algorithm)&nbsp; The GUI does not have to be as fully documented.</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>All work must be done by your group. </b></font>That is, no 
sharing of code between groups is allowed.&nbsp; All algorithmic code, e.g., the 
implementations of simplex, the Hungarian algorithm etc., must be written by 
your group.&nbsp; With that said,&nbsp; you may use any off -the-shelf GUI 
software you find (as long as it has not been developed by any other class 
group).&nbsp; In particular,&nbsp; if you can find good GUIs for implementing 
basic graph editing (needed for many of the projects) you may&nbsp; use them.</p>

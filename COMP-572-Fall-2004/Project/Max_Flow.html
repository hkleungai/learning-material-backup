<p>COMP572 -- Fall 2004</p>
<h2><u><font color="#0000FF">MAX-FLOW </font></u><font color="#0000FF"><u>Project Specification</u></font></h2>
<h2><font size="3" color="#FF0000">A: (1 person) Implement 
Ford-Fulkerson algorithm</font></h2><p>You should implement the Edmonds-Karp version of the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm.</p>
<p>Input:<br>
The input is read from standard input or a file (your documentation should indicate which)&nbsp; The first line contains an integer n 
where n is the number of nodes of the network. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 
n-1. Each of the next n lines of the input contains n integers. The j-th integer 
in the i-th line indicates the capacity of the directed edge from node i to node 
j. The source and sink will always be 0 and n-1 respectively.<br>
You can assume:<br>
1. n is between 2 and 50.<br>
2. All the capacities are less than 1,000,000,000.<br>
3. The max-flow is less than 1,000,000,000.<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
Print out the value of the max-flow (which is always an integer) in the first 
line.<br>
<br>
Print out the complete flow of the network in next n lines as follow: The j-th 
integer in the i-th line is the flow value from node i to node j. All the values 
must be integers. If the flow from u to v is f, then print out 0 instead of -f 
for the flow from v to u.<br>
<br>
Print out the corresponding min-cut in next two lines as follow: The first line 
should be a sorted sequence of nodes containing 0 and the second line should be 
a sorted sequence of nodes containing n-1. These two sets of integers correspond 
to the min-cut.<br>
<br>
Note that the flow values and the cut may not be unique. You just need to output 
one of them.<br>
<br>
Follow the format as sample output. Don’t print any other text character. Always 
use space to separate two values.<br>
<br>

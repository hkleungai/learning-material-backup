I want to add some additional information in HW2 12(b) to avoid misunderstandings.

1. In the table, the Priority in the last column only applies to the Priority (Preemptive) algorithm.

2. Round Robin essentially follows FCFS order. If P1, after quantum expires, rejoins the ready queue exactly the same time P3 arrives, then P1 executes before P3 in this problem. Please refer to the fifth note. Whenever there is a tie among processors (same arrival time, same remaining time, etc), they are inserted into the ready queue in the ascending order of process id.

Contact me if you have any questions.

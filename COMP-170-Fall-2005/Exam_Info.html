This includes everything taught in class, including those extra things written
on the board/transparencies that do not appear on the slides.&nbsp; Please note
that you are also responsible for material that was covered in the book that was
not covered in the slides.</font></p>
<p> <b>
<font color="#005522" size="4">***NEW*** <br>
</font></b><font size="4">The exam will cover the materials in Lectures 1-5
presented in class and everything in the book from pages 1-71 with the exception
of pp. 28-41 (section 1.4).&nbsp; Please note that this means that the exam
definitely covers the <i>extended GCD algorithm</i> and how to calculate
inverses<br>

Make sure that you can answer all of the questions on the homeworks correctly,
and understand why they are correct.&nbsp; We will not ask the exact same
questions but some of the exam questions will be similar to the homework
questions.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Practice by trying to work out the questions at the end of
each of the textbook's sections, especially the ones that provide hints. If you
want to know if your solutions are correct,&nbsp; please make appointments with
the TAs to discuss the solutions</font></p>

clear explanations will loose a lot of points on the exam</font></p>

this semester. This means that everything covered in the slides numbered
Lectures 1-18 (and the associated material in the book and tutorials) can be
asked on the exam&nbsp; <br>
</font></b>The only exceptions to this are the two small sections of the slides
that we did not cover which are<br>
(i) In Lecture 15, you do not need to know the 3rd section &quot;The Principle of
Inclusion-Exclusion for Counting&quot; (note that you are responsible for the first
two subsections of Lecture 15, just not for the third).&nbsp; In particular,&nbsp;
you do need to know &quot;Inclusion-Exclusion for Probability&quot;.<br>
(ii) In Lecture 18,&nbsp; you do not need to know the material after page 31
(which is the page that says that &quot;material form this point on, will not be on
the exam&quot;).<br>
(iii) Lecture 19 (Intro to Graphs) will NOT be on the exam<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <b>
<font color="#005522" size="4"> <br>

material covered in the handouts available in the <font color="#005522">&quot;other&quot;</font>
column on the <a href="Notes/index.htm">Notes page</a>.&nbsp; The only exception
to this is that<br>
(i) You do not need to know the handout on <a href="Notes/Adv_DandC_v1.pdf">
Floors &amp; Ceilings in Divide and Conquer</a> which is in the
<font color="#005522">&quot;other&quot;</font> column for 10/11/05<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="4">With that said,&nbsp; please note that&nbsp; the majority of
the questions on the exam (approximately 75%) will be on material covered <b>
AFTER</b> the&nbsp; 2nd midterm (this ensures that the three tests, taken
together,&nbsp; give approximately equal weighting to all material taught this
semester). </font></p>

<h3>Comments on the marking of Assignment 3</h3>
Below is a list of common mistakes that students made in assignment 3. These are 
the type of errors that would cause the solutions to be marked wrong on an exam.&nbsp; 
Please read this list and try to understand why these are mistakes.<ul>
   <li>In 1(a):
	<ul>
	<li>Some students started the proof from <b><font color="#CC0000">"Assume (n choose k) > (n choose k-1)"</font>
	</b>and<b><font color="#CC0000"> then concluded</font></b> the statement&nbsp; 
	was true. <br>
	You need to be very clear (in both your explanation and your own mind) what 
	statement you are <b><font color="#CC0000">assuming</font></b> and what 
	statement you are <font color="#CC0000"><b>concluding (proving)</b></font></li>
	<li>Some students tried to prove by induction, but <b><font color="#CC0000">did 
	not show the induction step</font></b>, i.e., why if (k-1) is true, then k 
	is true.<br>
	(for those of you who do not know induction, don't worry.&nbsp; We will 
	learn it in the next chapter).</li>
	<li>Some students proved the inequality for the case when k = n/2 only and then concluded&nbsp; 
	that the statement is true. <br>
	If you are asked to prove a statement for a range of values,
	<font color="#CC0000"><b>you must prove it for all of the values in the 
	range,&nbsp; not just a few of the values.<br>
&nbsp;</b></font></li>
	</ul>
   </li>
   <li>In Problem 2, Some students had problems with the meaning of "distinct".<ul>
   <li><b><font color="#CC0000">&quot;distinct&quot; here means &quot;different&quot;. </font></b>&nbsp;You 
	can think of each of the chairs as having&nbsp; a different label or a name<br>
&nbsp;</li>
 </ul></li>
	<li>In Problem 3, A lot of students didn't know how to explain their 
	solution. So they gave examples instead<ul>
   <li><font color="#CC0000"><b>An example is not an explanation.<br>
&nbsp;</b></font></li>
 </ul></li>
	<li>In Problem 6, 
	<ul>
		<li>Some students forgot to write a&nbsp; combinatorial proof. </li>
		<li>Some students&nbsp; took "combinatorial proof = prove by example". Then 
		they plugged&nbsp;&nbsp; numbers and showed the equality. for that 
		example.<br>
		<font color="#CC0000"><b>Showing that something is true for a particular 
		example is not a proof that it is always correct. </b></font></li>
		<li>Some students wrote down what the LHS counts and what the RHS counts, but didn't show why 
		the two sides are actually counting the same thing.<br>
		A correct explanation would run something like:&nbsp;
		<font color="#CC0000"><b>consider counting X;&nbsp; one way of counting 
		X is to do ... which gives the RHS;&nbsp; another way of counting X is 
		to do .... which gives the LHS.&nbsp; Therefore, LHS=RHS. <br>
&nbsp;</b></font></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>In Problem 7, a few students wrote down some algebraic steps to expand 
	the sum and&nbsp; then "Bang", arrived at the answer without showing how 
	they arrived there.</li>
 </ul>&nbsp;<p>Please note that we have seen a lot of &quot;similar answers&quot; 
appearing in different papers but no acknowledgements.&nbsp; Please acknowledge 
whom you worked with!</p>

<div id="introduction">
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>In this assignment you will design the game "<b>Animal
War</b>" based on your OOP knowledge on inheritance and
polymorphism, and simulate the game given an input.</p>
<p>Animal Wars is a turn-based game consisting of 2 players. At
the beginning of the game, each of the two players P1 and P2 starts
with 5 animals with positions labelled from i = 0 to 4.</p>
<p>Fig 1:</p>
<img src="pa5_ex1.png"> <br>

<p>Upon object instantiation, all the position information of the animal, its allies and enemies will be injected into the object for you to implement the more complicated game logics described later.
The constructor of the class Animal (the base class of all other animal classes):</p>
<pre><code>
Animal::Animal(Game* game, int player, int position) {
	allies = game->animals[player];
	enemies = game->animals[!player];
	pos = position;
	is_dead = false;

}
</code></pre>

<p>All animals have the following attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li><code><strong>hp</strong></code>: an integer value
that determines how many damage points the animal can take before it
dies</li>
<li><code><strong>atk_damage</strong></code>: an integral point of the
damage dealt (incurred) on its attacking opponent</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, all the animals <b>MUST</b> have the
following behaviours:</p>
<ol>
<li><code><strong>attack</strong></code>: deal (incur) damage to an
enemy/enemies on the opposite side, if the damage dealt is larger than
the opponent's current HP, the opponent <code><strong>die</strong></code>s.</li>
<li><code><strong>defend</strong></code>:
alter the final damage dealt on oneself, or respond to the attacker
according to its defensive skill</li>
<li><code><strong>takeDamage</strong></code>:
Deduct HP according to&nbsp; a "damage value" defined by the
animal's <code><strong>defend</strong></code>
behaviour</li>
<li><code><strong>die</strong></code>,
can no longer attack or become a target of the enemies' attacks</li>
</ol>
<p>If you take a look at the Animal.h file in the provided skeleton code, the declarations of the Animal's behaviours look like this:</p>
<pre><code>
	virtual void attack() = 0;
	virtual void defend(Animal* opponent, int damage);

	void takeDamage(int damage);
	void die();
</code></pre>
<p>Since different animals should behave differently when <code><strong>attack</strong></code> and <code><strong>defend</strong></code>, you should override these 2 methods in the derived classes to implement the specific behaviour of each animal.</p>
<p>However, the <code><strong>takeDamage</strong></code> and <code><strong>die</strong></code> behaviour should be <strong>THE SAME FOR ALL ANIMALS</strong>. 
You may use these 2 methods in your implementation of the <code><strong>attack</strong></code> and <code><strong>defend</strong></code> behaviours of other animals, 
but you should not override <code><strong>takeDamage</strong></code> and <code><strong>die</strong></code> in the derived classes.</p>
<br>
<h4>Position Rule:</h4>
<p>An animal will attack the enemy of the same position index on
the other side, and it will attack whoever else closest to it if the
opposite enemy is dead, break ties by choosing an enemy with the
smallest position index. The distance between 2 animals is defined as
the absolute value of the difference of their position index.<span class="auto-style1"> </span></p>
<p>Using the Fig.1 above as an example, <b>Shark</b>
of Player 2 (at position 2) should attack:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Bat</b> (at position 2 on the player 1 side,
distance = 0), if the Bat is alive;</li>
<li><b>Hawk</b> (at position 1 on the player 1
side, distance = 1), if the Bat is dead but the Hawk is alive;</li>
<li><b>Dog</b> (at position 3 on the player 1 side,
distance = 1), if both the Bat and the Hawk are dead, and the Dog is
alive.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dog</span>
(at position 0 on the player 1 side, distance = 2),&nbsp; if the
animals above (Bat, Hawk and Dog(at position 3) ) are all dead</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shark</span>
(at position 4 on the player 1 side, distance = 2), if other animals
are all dead</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the above <b>Position Rule</b>
applies to all animals.</p><br>
<h4>Example - Dog:</h4>
Dog's <code><strong>attack</strong></code> behaviour:<br>
<pre><code>
// Attack according to the Position Rule.
// Note that the enemy's <strong>defend</strong> method is passively called in the attacker's <strong>attack</strong> method.
void Dog::attack()
{
	if(!enemies[pos]->isDead())
		enemies[pos]->defend(this, atk_damage);
	else {
		for(int i = 1; i < 5; i++)
		{
			if(pos-i >= 0 && !enemies[pos-i]->isDead())
			{
				enemies[pos-i]->defend(this, atk_damage);
				break;
			}
			else if(pos+i < 5 && !enemies[pos+i]->isDead())
			{
				enemies[pos+i]->defend(this, atk_damage);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<br>
Dog's <code><strong>defend</strong></code> behaviour (inherited from the base class Animal):<br>
<pre><code>
// Defend the damage from an opponent
void Animal::defend(Animal* opponent, int damage)
{
	takeDamage(damage);
}
</code></pre>

Dog's <code><strong>takeDamage</strong></code> behaviour (inherited from the base class Animal):<br>
<pre><code>
void Animal::takeDamage(int damage)
{
	hp -= damage;
	if( hp <= 0 )
		die();
}
</code></pre>

Dog's <code><strong>die</strong></code> behaviour (inherited from the base class Animal):<br>
<pre><code>
void Animal::die()
{
	is_dead = true;
}
</code></pre>


<p>When the game starts, P1 and P2 will take turns to attack
(Player 1 always starts first in this game). When a player is
attacking, the other one will be defending. During a player's attacking
turn,
all of his animals who are still alive will attack in ascending order of their position index. If the
game does not end in a turn, it will proceed to the next turn where the
attacking player will become the defending player, and vice versa. The
game ends when <b>either one or both sides</b> are all dead.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>
<p>The input is a single line with 10 integers. The first 5 integers correspond to the animal IDs(listed in the next section) of the 5 animals from position 0 to 4 in Player 1's team.
The last 5 integers correspond to the animal IDs of the 5 animals from position 0 to 4 in Player 2's team</p>
<p>For example, the input corresponding to Fig.1 above is: (You should check the animal IDs in the next section)</p>
<pre><code>0 2 3 0 5 1 4 5 1 2</code></pre>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>The program should simulate the HP of all animals at the end of the each turn, output "DEAD" if an animal is dead (HP <= 0).
When the game ends, it should output the winner as "Player X Wins!", or output "Draw!" if both sides are dead at the end of the game (Please refer to the next section to see how can a "draw" happen).</p>
<p>For example, the expected output corresponding to Fig.1 is:</p>
<pre><code>
Turn 1 Player 1 attacks:
Player 1

<h2> Animals </h2>
<p>Different animals have different HP and attack damage, and
they should attack and defend differently according to their nature.</p>
<p>In this assignment, you will need to design the classes and

</table>
</div>
<p>*Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Indefensible attack/damage" means that the attack/damage
will not trigger the defensive skill of the opponent (i.e. Opponents must take 100% of the damage and they cannot revenge).
For example in the Fig.1 testcase:
<pre><code>
Turn 1 Player 1 attacks: // Player 1's Hawk attacks in this turn, dealing 5 damages to Turtle instead of 2
Player 1
Dog:30 Hawk:25 Bat:19 Dog:30 Shark:28 
Player 2
Cat:20 Turtle:30 Shark:26 Cat:20 Hawk:21 
Turn 2 Player 2 attacks: // Player 2's Hawk attacks Shark in this turn, and it is not revenged by the Shark 
Player 1
Dog:24 Hawk:24 Bat:14 Dog:24 Shark:23 
Player 2
Cat:20 Turtle:29 Shark:25 Cat:20 Hawk:21 
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>Revenges occurs only if the defending animal(who has revenge ability) survives that attack. i.e. You should check whether the defending animal is still alive before revenging.</li>
<li>Bat heals themselves after the enemy's <code><strong>defend</strong></code> behaviour, so the correct sequence will be: Bat attacks->enemy defends and takes damages->enemy revenges(if any)->Bat heals itself. Also note that Bats do not "over heal" themselves, their HP cannot exceed the Max HP after the healing.
For example, the Turn 1 and Turn 7 of the Fig.1 testcase:
<pre><code>
// Bat attacks Shark-> Shark revenges for 2 damages-> Bat heals itself for 1 HP = 19HP at the end of turn 1
Turn 1 Player 1 attacks: 
Player 1
Dog:30 Hawk:25 Bat:19 Dog:30 Shark:28 
Player 2
Cat:20 Turtle:30 Shark:26 Cat:20 Hawk:21 

Turn 6 Player 2 attacks:
Player 1
Dog:9 Hawk:22 Bat:2 Dog:9 Shark:9 
Player 2
Cat:10 Turtle:17 Shark:15 Cat:10 Hawk:13 
// Bat starts with 2 HP and attacks Shark-> Shark revenges for 2 damages ->Bat dies, cannot heal itself
Turn 7 Player 1 attacks: 
Player 1
Dog:9 Hawk:22 Bat:DEAD Dog:9 Shark:7 
Player 2
Cat:5 Turtle:12 Shark:11 Cat:5 Hawk:9 
</code></pre>
</li>

<li>This is how a "Draw" condition can happen. e.g. The game goes to a state that only 2 animals are standing alive. A shark with HP 1 attacks a cat with HP 1, the shark dies after it kills the cat, no animals alive on both sides after this turn therefore it is a draw.
You may also want to take a look at the draw test case (and its expected output) provided in the skeleton code.
</li>
<li>It is guaranteed in the input that there will be no more
than one Army Ant Queen in each team</li>
</ol>
<h4>To-Do 1:</h4>
<p>For each of the animals listed above, complete the corresponding class header and .cpp file. Implement necessary functions as described in the above table.
After you have implemented them, remember to include the header files in the Game.cpp and instantiate the animal in the <code>Game::load()</code> function.
You may refer to the Dog.h and Dog.cpp files as an example.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Special Moves</h4>
<p>To make the game more interesting, several combinations of
animals can make some special moves:</p>
<ol>
<li>With more than 2 (&gt;=3) flying animals (Hawk, Bat and Dragon) alive on the
same side, they can <code><strong>harass</strong></code> the opponents and each of them deals 1
indefensible damage to all enemies in their attacking turn</li>
<ul>
<li>Bats also heal themselves for 1 HP during the <code><strong>harass</strong></code></li>
<li>Dragons <code><strong>harass</strong></code> with fire breaths, dealing 2 indefensible damages to
all enemies instead</li>
</ul>
<li>With more than 2 (&gt;=3) swimming animals (Turtle, Shark) alive on the
same side, they can <code><strong>summonTsunami</strong></code> and each of them deals 1
indefensible damage to all enemies in their attacking turn</li>
<ul>
<li>Sharks are too reckless in attacking, dealing 2 indefensible damages
to all enemies instead but at the cost of hurting themselves for 2
damages</li>
</ul>
<li>With 5 Army Ants on the same side, they <code><strong>marchAndConquer</strong></code> 
whatever in front of them, each of them deals 3 indefensible damages to all enemies
in their attacking turn</li>
<ul>
<li>The Queen does not attack, but she will heal other ants
for 2 HP(excluding herself). This healing also do not "over heal" the ants. i.e. The ants' HP can never exceed the Max HP defined above.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h4>To-Do 2:</h4>
<p>Implement these 3 special moves for the corresponding animals. After you finished, simulate the effect of these special moves in the
<code>Game::start()</code> function. The special moves should be simulated after the normal attacks in each round. (See the instructions in the skeleton code, which clearly stated where should you put your codes.)</p>
Make sure you have checked that there are <strong>enough alive animals</strong> for a special move.
You may add data members and functions to the <code>Game</code> class to help you complete the required logics.
</div>
<div id="requirement">
<h2> Assignment Requirements </h2>
<ol>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> use the <a href="PA5_skeleton.zip">skeleton
code</a> provided and complete the classes of all the animals mentioned in
the above section. The abstract base class "Animal" and the "Dog" class are already completed as
examples for you. The zip file includes 2 test cases. 1 normal test case which is the same as the Fig.1 example. Another one is a "Draw" test case, and there is also a corresponding expected output for you to check the correctness of your program.
Before you start, you may want to use the test case
"<code>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</code>" (10 dogs, 5 on each team) to help you get a basic idea of the game play.
 

</li>
<li>You should design the inheritance relations according to
the information given in the above section, as well as the polymorphic
behaviours of the animals.</li>
<li>After finishing the animal classes, you should simulate the
game in the <code>Game::start()</code> method. In each
turn, the program will output the remaining HP of the animals on each
side. The game will proceed until either one or both sides are all
dead. When the game ends, the program output the winner. These are
already done by the skeleton code. Your task is to add the special
moves of the animal combinations as described in the above section in
the simulation. You may add any necessary data members to help in the
Game.h file. Note that we will
use our own testing program to grade your program. Therefore, please
follow the I/O of the functions because we will use a different program
to test your implementation.</li>
<li>We have provided you some input test cases and the expected
output for your basic testing only. You may need to come up with your
own test cases. Please submit
your good test cases if this exposes some of the unique features of
your program, or you think they are good to be used to test other
programs.</li>
<li>Please submit the following files:
<ol>
<li>Game.h Game.cpp</li>
<li>Cat.h Cat.cpp</li>
<li>Hawk.h Hawk.cpp</li>
<li>Bat.h Bat.cpp</li>
<li>Turtle.h Turtle.cpp</li>
<li>Shark.h Shark.cpp</li>
<li>ArmyAnt.h ArmyAnt.cpp</li>
<li>ArmyAntQueen.h ArmyAntQueen.cpp</li>
<li>Dragon.h Dragon.cpp</li>
</ol>
<strong>You may want to hand in more files than those stated above to help design your inheritance relations. If you have altered Animal.h/ Animal.cpp to include some advanced features, please hand in those as well.</strong>
You may want submit a README file with a few words to justify the
design of the classes, the inheritance relations...etc. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="grading">
<h2> Grading Scheme </h2>
<ol>
<li>The correctness of the program will worth 40 points. </li>
<li>The design of the inheritance relations will worth 20
points.
<ul>
<li>Hint: A good design should have high code reusability
and is easy to maintain and modify</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The design of the polymorphic behaviours will worth 20
points.
<ul>
<li>Hint: A good design should avoid runtime checking of
the class objects, but instead exercise polymorphic behaviours by
dynamic binding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="bonus">
<h2> Bonus (Maximum 10%)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_(mythology)" target="_blank">Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerberus" target="_blank">Cerberus</a> and the special moves as
described below, you may define the values of their HP, damage, and the
behaviours of attack and defence in your own way, and with the
following features:
<ul>
<li>Phoenix revives with full HP upon death, this occurs
only once in each game</li>
<li>Cerberus can organize a group attack(a special move)
with other ally dogs, Cerberus deals 2 while the other dogs deals 1
damage to all enemies</li>
<li>With more than 2 (&gt;=3) legendary animals(Dragon,
Phoenix and Cerberus) on the same side, they can weather the storm and
each of them will deal 3 damages to all enemies</li>
<li>All special moves deals indefensible damages </li>
</ul>
</li>
Remember to describe the inheritance relations of them in your README
file if you are going to implement this part! <li>Add other
interesting features to the game, it will be graded according to the
level of creativity and difficulty.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Please explain clearly in your README if you have done any
of the above.</li>

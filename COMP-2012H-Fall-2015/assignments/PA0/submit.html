<p align="left"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">You should always turn in your 
assignments promptly; we normally will not accept late assignment, even 
if it is late by one minute.&nbsp; However, we do understand that occasionally 
you need more time to finish your <i>programming </i>assignments beyond the deadline.&nbsp; 
Therefore, each student has a maximum of TWO penalty-free late days for your 
programming assignments, i.e., out of the five <u>programming</u> assignments, you can 
be </font><span class="auto-style1">late up to a total of two days</span><span class="auto-style2"> without any penalty. 
Note that we will only grade you the latest submission.&nbsp; If the assignment 
is late by one minute, you are one day late.</span></font></p>


<p align="left"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">You must use CASS (Course Assignment Submission System) to submit 
your programs by the due date and time. CASS information can be found in </font><i>
<font face="Courier New">
<a href="http://cssystem.cs.ust.hk/UGuides/cass/index.html">http://cssystem.cs.ust.hk/UGuides/cass/index.html</a>.</font><font face="Times New Roman">
</font></i><font face="Times New Roman">Please submit your files <u><i><b>individually</b></i></u> and do
<font color="#ff0000">NOT </font>tar or zip your files. Please <i>do not modify your files for the assignments on your machine after the due date and time. </i>We may need 
to take a look at them in the future as a reference in case of contention.</font></font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">contain your program(s) and 
documentation (including your acknowledgments) such as README, makefile, .cpp, 
.h, etc.<i> </i>&nbsp;Your README file must tell us</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> how to compile and 
use your program, and what the executable file(s) are.&nbsp; Include how you 
approach the problem and why your solutions work.&nbsp; In the file, you must explicitly acknowledge the resources (books, web 
sites, and so on) that you have consulted and the <i><b>people</b></i> you have discussed the 
assignment with (if they are students from other sessions, state their full names, student IDs 
	and what sessions they are in).&nbsp; If you have not consulted anyone, then simply state that explicitly as 
follows: </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>The work included in 
this program is all my own work.&nbsp; </i>Here is an example of a
    <a href="readme_template.txt">README</a> file and makefile (in <a href="makefile">Linux</a> and in <a href="Makefile_eclipse">Eclipse</a>).</font></p>


  </li>


  <li>
    
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">be completely self-contained; your 
program can only refer to the standard&nbsp;C++ libraries. If other non-standard 
.h files are included, please also submit them in the same directory.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">be able 
to be compiled and run on the <i>Lab2 Linux platform</i>.&nbsp; Your program 
	will be compiled there.&nbsp; If you develop your program in other platform, 
	please make sure that all the platform porting issues are resolved in your 
	submission.&nbsp; You do not need to submit your 
executable files because we will compile your program locally for testing.</font></p>

        <font face="Times New Roman">This means that your program
produces the correct outputs or results as specified in the assignment.
&nbsp;If some test cases are provided, make sure that your program at
least works correctly on all these test cases. &nbsp;However, you
should also consider additional test cases to check 
		whether your program completely satisfies the assignment specifications.
&nbsp;Designing good test cases, as one part of software testing, is an
important aspect of software development.&nbsp; Please feel free to submit your 
		interesting test cases to the submission directory as well.</font></p>

your program cannot be compiled, does not run correctly or works only
partially, you may receive partial credits at our discretion.
Therefore, try your best to accomplish as many parts as possible even
if your program does not completely work.&nbsp; In this case, </font>
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">you should state in your README 
		file what works and what does not so that we know how to test them

examine your output and your codes to determine the partial
credits.&nbsp; </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Program design and elegance (20%): </i>This
includes the overall design of your program, such as the correct use of
.cpp and .h files for separate compilation, makefiles, object-oriented
design, modularity, code conciseness, variable scoping, program and
call structures, etc.</font></p>


	</li>


	<li>
	
    
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Program documentation and comprehensibility (20%):

	indentation, </font></font><font face="Times New Roman">program readability, ease of use, user 
interface, etc. &nbsp;Some assignments may require you to use a documentation system such as Doxygen.</font></p>

  </li>


</ul>


<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">We understand that handling human 
input errors and checking for such errors can be tedious.&nbsp; While it is necessary 
to check some out-of-bound numbers or obviously wrong inputs, you may assume that users in 
general are well-behaved and rational.&nbsp; If user responses are not valid, 
your program may simply let the user know about the input error and prompt the user again or, in some 
exceptional cases, exit the program.&nbsp; Returned error values due to some 
function or system calls, on the other hand, need to be checked and handled properly.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The program you submit for grading must represent your own independent effort. &nbsp;To uphold academic integrity, <span style="font-style: italic;">plagiarism detection software</span>
will be used to detect plagiarism automatically. &nbsp;Note that
plagiarism detection is already a very mature area and such systems are
quite reliable and smart. &nbsp;Don't let others read or even
copy your program. &nbsp;You will get into trouble if another student's
submission is similar to yours. &nbsp;Suspected cheating and plagiarism
will be referred to the relevant University authorities for
disciplinary actions.</font></p>

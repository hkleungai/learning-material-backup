Sunday, May 25, 2003: </font></font></h3>
<h3> <font size="3" color="#000080">Due to 
the SARS situation and following the HKUST academic-affairs office

semester:</font></h3>

  <li><font color="#000080"><b>There will be no more face-to-face lectures this 
  semester. That is,&nbsp; all formal classes will be cancelled (unless the SARS

<H3>Course Overview:</H3>This course presents the fundamental techniques for 
designing efficient computer algorithms, proving their correctness, and 
analyzing their running times. General topics include review of asymptotics, 
mathematical analysis of algorithms (summations and recurrences), algorithm 
design techniques (such as divide-and-conquer,&nbsp; dynamic 
programming, and greedy algorithms), graph algorithms (minimum spanning trees 
and shortest paths) and NP-completeness.<P>

<H3>Course Work:</H3>Course work will consist of 4 homework assignments and 2 
exams (a midterm and a comprehensive final). Homeworks are to be turned in by 
the start of class on the due date. <STRONG>No late homeworks will be 
accepted.</STRONG> (So turn in what you have by the start of class.) In 
exceptional circumstances (illness, university business, or religious 
observances) extensions may be granted. However, all extensions must be approved 
by me <STRONG>before</STRONG> the due date. 
<P>The primary benefit to working on homeworks is to&nbsp; prepare for the exams; exam questions are often variants of homework problems. For this reason 
I encourage you to spend time alone thinking about each problem and your 
approach in solving it. You are allowed to and encouraged to 
<STRONG>discuss</STRONG> homework problems with your classmates. However, you 
must <STRONG>write up</STRONG> the solutions on your own. In particular: 
<UL>
  <LI>Homework solutions must be written in your own words (not copied or 
  modified from someone else's write-up). 
  <LI>You must understand your solution and its derivation. (I may ask you to 
  explain your solution to me.) 
  <LI>You must acknowledge your collaborators (whether or not they are 
  classmates) or any other outside sources on each homework. </LI></UL>
<P>&nbsp;<P>Failing to do any of these will be considered plagiarism, and may result in a 
failing grade on an assignment or in the course&nbsp;&nbsp; in the course and notification for appropriate disciplinary 
action. As an example of plagiarism,&nbsp;&nbsp; if we find that your solution 
is copied, without attribution,&nbsp; from something on the web, this would be 
treated as plagiarism. On the other hand,&nbsp; if you report that you found a 
solution to a similar problem on the web, tell where this was,&nbsp; and write 
down the solution in your own words,&nbsp; this would be fine. <P>As a courtesy to the graders, homeworks should be written 
<STRONG>neatly</STRONG>. Poorly written work will not be graded. When writing 
algorithms be sure not only that your solution is correct, but also that it is 
easy for the grader to understand why your solution is correct. Part of your 
grade will be based not only on correctness, but also on the <STRONG>clarity, 
simplicity, and elegance</STRONG> of your solution.

<h3><a name="Assignment Schedule:">Assignment Schedule:</a></h3>
<p>Assignments should either be emailed&nbsp; to the instructor at
<a href="mailto:golin@cs.ust.hk">golin@cs.ust.hk</a> or submitted to the 
computer science department office (room 3528) by 5:00PM of the due date.&nbsp; 
When submitting to the department office please specify (and write on your 
paper) that this is meant for Dr Golin.&nbsp; Please also keep <b>copies</b> of 
your homeworks so that,&nbsp; if there is a mixup,&nbsp; I can ask you to 
resubmit it.</p>

  <li>The final exam will cover ALL material covered in the lecture notes (1-20) 
  presented on the <font color="#000080"><b>class </b></font><b>
  <a href="Notes/"><font color="#000080">lecture 
  page</font></a><font color="#000080">.&nbsp; </font></b></li>
  <li>Lectures 18, 19, 20 (NP completeness) will only be worth 10% of the final 
  exam</li>
  <li>The exam format will be similar to last semester's
<a href="Exams/midterm.ps">midterm</a> and
<a href="Exams/final.ps">final</a>.&nbsp; Please 
  note that the material taught during the first few weeks last semester was 
  slightly different&nbsp; than this semester's so you did not learn the 
  background to question 2 of the midterm. Please also note that last semester's 
  final was not comprehensive (i.e., did not cover a lot of the material from 
  the first half of the term).&nbsp; This semester's final <b>will be 
  comprehensive</b>.&nbsp; All material in lectures 1-20 can be on the exam.</li>

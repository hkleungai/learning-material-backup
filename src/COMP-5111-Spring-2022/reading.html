    <h3>Grading Scheme of Reading Assignment</h3>
    <h4>- Participation in Class Presentations (Max 5%): C1+C2, where</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>C1 (Max 2%) = 0.5 * number of presentation lectures attended</li>
        <li>C2 (Max 3%) = 0.5 * number of questions asked<br/>
            Right after each presentation lecture, please claim your credit by sending an
            email to <a href="mailto:csta5111@cse.ust.hk">csta5111@cse.ust.hk</a> through your CSD/ITSC account
            with a subject headling &quot;<strong>COMP5111 - Class Participation</strong>&quot; and
            describe briefly the question(s) that you have asked in the presentation(s).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>- Report Participation (Max 5%): 2.5 * (P1 + P2), where</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>P1 (Max 1%) = number of reading reports commented / 10</li>
        <li>P2 (Max 1%) = total points of comments made / the maximum total points of comments made by a student in
            class
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>The points of the comments made are computed as the follows:
<ol>
    <li>For each comments made, it will be given a mark from 1, 2 or 3.
    <ul>
        <li>1 is for the comments belonging to Category 1: It is unfair to get a full score for those questions that are essentially applicable to any papers. Examples are: "Can you elaborate more on XXX?", "What is XXX?", and so on.  Such questions at most get one out of the three points. Also, questions that we are not able to follow fall into this category.</li>
        <li>2 is for the comments belonging to Category 2: Questions that score two points are those putting in the context of the paper and the reading report. They reflect the issues that the report have not adequately clarified or missed. The issues are essential (to the understanding of novelty, threat to validity or usefulness of the work). Indeed, the issues have already been explained in the paper. Questions in this category likely arise because of the confusing/misleading /careless writing in the reading report.</li>
        <li>3 is for the comments belonging to Category 3: Questions that score three points are those that not only fall into Category 2 but they also point out issues that need to be explained by the paper authors. In other words, questions in this category are put down as a result of critical thinking and good understanding of the paper.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>For each reading report, your total point = R3 + R2 + R1.
    <ul>
        <li>R3 = the number of comments graded as 3 * 3</li>
        <li>R2 = MIN(MAX(R3, 3), the number of comments graded as 2 * 2). </li>
        <li>R1 = MIN(MAX(R3, 3), the number of comments graded as 1 * 1)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>total points of comments made = sum of points for all reports</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h4>- Presentation (Max 5%):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Good timing control: 1%</li>
    <li>Clarity (being able to give a clear and intuitive overview of the key ideas in the paper): 1%</li>
    <li>Fluency (effectiveness in expressing using English): 1%</li>
    <li>Coverage (being able to clarify the issues raised by other students in reading
        report): 1%
    </li>
    <li>Q&amp;A: 1%</li>
</ul>
<h4>- Reading Report (Max 5%):</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Comprehensibility: 1%</li>
    <li>Clarity (concrete explanation of the key points in the paper technically): 1%</li>
    <li>Ability to identify the key research issues and insights (understand why the
        paper is accepted): 1%
    </li>
    <li>Reflection (being able to understand why the technique proposed outperforms
        existing ones, the underlying limitations and suggest interesting future work): 1%
    </li>
    <li>Responsiveness to issues raised by other students: 1%</li>
</ul>

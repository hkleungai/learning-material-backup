<li>Feb 1: We did experimentation during the Winter break on the open-source programming tools and environments used in this course. We recommend using Java 11 (SE), Eclipse 2021-6, Randoop 4.2.7, Evosuite 1.2.0, GZoltar 1.7.2 for the programming assignments. Students may use IntelliJ for the assignments if they prefer doing so. During our experiments, we found EclEmma in Eclipse provided more detailed coverage information than Jacoco in IntelliJ. Detailed coverage information is useful to automated fault localization.</li>

    Although some tools that we introduce in the course may happen to work with the latest Java version, their official releases target Java 11. You may refer to the website of these tools for further information. We choose open-source tools so that you can freely customize them to suit your need in future.
    Like most open-source tools developed by the research community, the
    documentation of some tools may not be well maintained.&nbsp;

<h3>Course Description</h3>
<blockquote>
This is a postgraduate core course counted towards the area of software technology. The goal of this course is to introduce the principles of various automated analysis
    and testing techniques as well as the ways that they can be used to manage
    software code quality. Students will acquire fundamental knowledge of program abstraction, verification, testing, coverage, analysis, reliability, and fault detection. The course will also discuss how to carry out the empirical experimentation for program analysis and testing. Wherever applicable, concepts will be complemented by tools developed in academia and industry. This enables students to understand the maturity and limitations of various techniques discussed in the course and put them in practice.
    The course requires prior programming knowledge in Java.

<h3>Schedule &amp; Venue</h3>
<blockquote>
    Tuesday &amp; Thursday 13:30 - 14:50, Room 2503<br />

<h3>Course Learning Outcomes</h3>
<blockquote>
    The intent of this course is to
    provide students with the fundamentals
    of software analysis and testing techniques. They will learn these techniques
    from two perspectives: concepts
    and tool support. T<font face="helvetica">opics will be explored at different levels of depths.
    </font>Following the first perspective, students will study the quality issues arising
    from software maintenance and the theories to address them.
    Following the second perspective, students will study how these techniques are supported by tools and their underlying engineering issues. Many of these tools are adopted by the software community to assure code quality.
    <br />
    <br />
    Upon completion of this course, students will be able to apply the fundamental knowledge of fault analysis, test coverage, program instrumentation, test generation, fault localization, mutation analysis, program repair, pointer analysis, program abstraction, program repair, mining software repositories and vulnerability analysis.
    Students will also be able to point out the maturity and limitations of various
    analysis and testing techniques. <strong> This course assumes prior knowledge of Java Programming.</strong>

    <em>Bonus:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Objective</strong>: Encourage students to further explore beyond the required tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Means</strong>: When students have completed a bonus task in the assignment, they will get the bonus points accordingly.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonus scheme</strong>: Be used as a "safety blanket" on the assignments capped by the maximum score of 100. It motivates hard-working students without sacrificing the less hard-working students.</li>
<li><strong>Examples</strong>:
If a student got 95 out of 100 for the basic tasks, but the student got 6 bonus points, the final score will be: MIN(95+6, 100) = 100.
If a student got 100 out of 100 and got 0 bonus points, the final score will be: MIN(100+0, 100) = 100.</li>

Students who are involved (including the copier and the helper) in an incident of plagiarism will receive a failing grade for the course and the incident will be reported for appropriate disciplinary actions.

<h3>Reading Assignment: Report, Presentation and Participation</h3>
In this course, each student will need to read a paper from the reading list, give a presentation and submit a report of the paper following the report
        template available <a href="./Reading_Report_Template.docx"> here</a> (<a href="readings/Research%20Pattern.pdf">common research patterns</a>).
    <br><br>
    <strong>Note 1</strong>: We use Canvas for reading assignment. Contact with TA if you have trouble with Canvas.<br>
    <strong>Note 2</strong>: The date for presentation might be changed subject to the number of students enrolled, etc.<br>
    <strong>Note 3</strong>: The reading report and presenttation must be exclusive to this course. You CANNOT re-use the report/presentation from another course. You CANNOT re-use your assignment in previous years.
    <br><br>
    The following is a set of deliverables required:
<ol>
<li>Select a technical research paper from the reading list below by <span class="style3"> March 4</span>.
    <ol type="a"><li>Please login to Canvas, choose 'discussion' from left navigation bar, then click '+ Discussion' to create a new discussion topic.</li>
    <li>Please name the new discussion topic according to "Student Name (Last name_First name)-Paper Name-Conference". For example, "LI_Meiziniu-An Empirical Study of Refactorings and Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems-ICSE'21".</li>
    <li>In the discussion content of the created topic, the student should put down (a) his/her name, (b) paper title and authors, (c) full citation reference, and (d) the paper abstract. Later the student needs to complete and post the reading report under the discussion topic. </li>
    <li>Make sure the created topic is public and viewable till the course end. There is no need to change other options.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Update this <a href="https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/sccheung_connect_ust_hk/EeJ6U3SWLj9Jhxwl1OUSJgQBbUkZJzBXhUEy18VONAR5hQ?e=JT2Gdk"> MS Excel Spreadsheet</a> by <span class="style3">
    March 4</span> (Contact TA if the spreadsheet cannot be accessed).
    Failure to mark a timeslot and select a valid paper by <font face="helvetica"> <span class="style3">
    March 4</span></font>
    is subject to a penalty of 3 points out of the 20 points of reading assignment.<br />
    <em>Note: If a student&#39;s selected paper collides with that has already been selected by another classmate, the student
    will be asked to select another one</em>.</li>
<li>Submit Reading Report by <span class="style3">April 14</span>.
    <ol type="a">
    <li>Submit the reading report to Canvas.</li>

    </ol></li>
<li>Read other's discussion topic and leave comments by <span class="style3">April 28</span>, the first day of presentation.
    <ol type="a">
        <li>This is part of grading scheme.</li>
        <li>Use the reply function in Canvas</li>
        <li>A student can ask questions/clarification, propose your suggestions, etc., on other classmates&#39; discussion topic.</li>
        <li>When a student leaves comments, please ensure the referred sentences, like 'Section XX, para XX' are clearly quoted. </li>
        <li>Students are also encouraged to reply others' comments.</li>
        <li>Students can optionally submit a report to discuss specific issues encountered

            <span class="style3">May 11
    </ol>
<li>Here are some Reading report samples (<a href="readings/sample1/AnandFSE12.html">sample 1</a>, <a href="readings/sample2/PradelICSE2013.html">sample 2</a>, <a href="readings/sample3/ServantFSE2012.html">sample 3</a>), including classmates&#39; comments. Note in previous year we use Google Doc so the comments are inline.</li>
<li>Presentation on <span class="style3">
        April 28 (Thu), May 3 (Tue), May 5 (Thu), May 7 (Sat), May 10 (Tue)</span>.
        <br><em>Note</em>: Students are encourage to ask questions during the Q&amp;A (See grading scheme).
    If the presentations&nbsp; take place face-to-face at classroom, students are required to send an email to TA and tell him how many questions have been asked and what they are
    after each lecture. If the presentations take place at Zoom, students are
    required to type their questions at the Chat over Zoom, and then ask the
    questions.</li>
<li>Each presentation lasts 10 minutes plus 5 minutes Q&amp;A. Please mark your slot at the

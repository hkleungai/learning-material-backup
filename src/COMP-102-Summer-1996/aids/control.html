If a programming language can't let you making choices, it is nearly useless.
Control flow statements, are very important in a general purpose programming
language like C++ because they let you making decisions inside your program.
<p>

The following teaching aid help you understand more about the control flow
statements: if...then...else, while..., do...while. it convert the program
you typed to a flow chart and let you run the program using the flow chart.
<p>

Type the code segment you want to convert to flow chart in the input code
window and press the "Convert!" button. Then, the main window will display
the corresponding flow chart. Now, you can press the "Run" button to run the
program on the flow chart. 
<p>

Notes:
the program now only support the control flow statements: if...then...else, 
while...., do...while. Function, variable and class declaration are not 
supported. <p>

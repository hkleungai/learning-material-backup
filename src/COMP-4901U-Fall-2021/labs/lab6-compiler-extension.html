      <p>You have now written a compiler for Amy, a simple functional language.
The final lab project is to design and implement a new functionality of
your own choice on top of the compiler you built so far. In preparation
for this, you should aim to learn about the problem domain by searching
the appropriate literature. The project includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>designing and implementing the new functionality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>documenting the results in a written report document</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This project is optional</strong>, meaning that you do not have to complete it.</p>

<p><strong>Grading scheme:</strong>
If you choose to complete this project,
the marks you obtain for it can be used to recover
<em>at most half</em> of the marks you lost in the previous labs/mini-projects.
For example, if you have an average of 40% in your mini-project grades,
then obtaining 100% in the optional project will prop your overall labs grade to
40 + 100/2 = 90%.
The overall labs grade is capped at 100%. So
if, on the other hand, you had an average of 60% in your mini-projects
and you still obtained 100% in the optional project,
your new grade will be 100%, <em>not</em> 110%.
<!-- – in other words this optional project cannot be used to recover
final exam marks. --></p>

<p>Because this is potentially quite a big bonus,
the compiler extension project will be evaluated rather strictly
(do not expect an easy 100% grade).</p>

<h2 id="selecting-a-project-topic">Selecting a Project Topic</h2>

<p>In the following document, we list several project ideas, but you should
also feel free to submit your own.</p>

<p><strong>However, you should make sure to contact me (the course instructor)
before selecting a project, even if it is already a listed project.</strong>
Indeed, I will try to make sure that no two groups work on the same project topic.</p>

<p>Because not all
projects are equally difficult, we annotated each of them with the
expected workload. The suggested projects cover a wide range of
complexity, and we will evaluate your submissions with that complexity
in mind. For instance, for a project marked with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(1)</code> (relatively low
complexity) we will be expecting a polished, well-tested and
well-documented extension, whereas projects on the other end (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(3)</code>) may
be more prototypical. For all submissions, however, we require that you
deliver code that compiles and a set of example input files that
demonstrate the new functionality.</p>

<p><a href="../files/extensions.pdf">Project ideas</a></p>

<h2 id="project-orientation">Project Orientation</h2>

<p>To give you a chance to validate your understanding of the
project and what’s expected of you, please feel free to contact me
by email and possibly set up a meeting in person.
But before you do, think
about the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What are the features you will add to the compiler/language?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would be some (short) programs highlighting the use of these
features?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What changes might be required in each compiler phase and/or what
new phases would you add? (Very roughly)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-implementation-and-report">Project Implementation and Report</h2>

<p><strong>Deadline: December 18, 2021, 23:00</strong></p>

<p>Your implementation and a report are due on this date
at the latest.
Any later submission will not be considered.</p>

<p><strong>Note that you should try to submit your work earlier if possible</strong>,
which will allow me to come back to you with feedback and potentially suggest improvements or fixes.
If you submit right before the deadline,
I will not have any time to come back to you
because the final grades will be due for reporting to the CSE department soon after.</p>

<p>You will develop your project on top of your
implementation of Amy.
Please submit <em>all the <strong>source</strong> files</em> in your project to me, in a zip archive,
so I can properly test it.
Your zip file should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your implementation, which must, to be graded at all, compile and be
able to run non-trivial examples.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subdirectory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extension-examples/</code> which includes some examples
that demonstrate your compiler extension in action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A subdirectory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">report/</code> which includes a PDF summarizing your
extension.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you did not manage to complete your planned features, or they are
partially implemented, make this clear in your report!</strong></p>

<p>You are encouraged to use the following (LaTeX) template for your
report:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../files/report-template.zip">LaTeX sources</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A compiled PDF version of the template with the required sections is available
here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../files/report-template.pdf">PDF Example</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Although you are not required to use the above template, your report
must contain at least the sections described in it with the appropriate
information. Note that writing this report will take some time, and you
should not do it at the last minute. The final report is an important
part of the compiler project. If you have questions about the template
or the contents of the report, make sure to ask them early.</p>

<!-- A common question is \"how long should the report be?\". There is no
definitive answer to that. Considering that the report will contain code
examples and a technical description of your implementation, it would be
surprising if it were shorter than 3 pages. -->
<p>Please try to stay within 6
pages or less for your report, but do include all code examples and technical descriptions
needed to truly understand your contribution.
A concise but well-written report is preferable to a long but poorly-written one.</p>

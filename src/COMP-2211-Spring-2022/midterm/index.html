						<ol>
	<li>The midterm exam may consist of <span
style="color:blue">T/F questions, short questions and long questions</span>. The details are to
be confirmed.</li>
	<li>The questions will be shown on screen <span
style="color:blue">one-at-a-time</span>.</li>
<!--	<li>Once you submit an answer to a question your
answer is final and
you cannot go back and change it.</li>-->
	<li>The midterm exam must be completed within <span
style="color:blue">2 hours</span> from the time
you start. Manage your pace accordingly so that you do not run out of
time.</li>
	<li>The midterm exam will be conducted on
Canvas. We will separate the questions from the
answers by creating 2 set of Canvas "quiz", one
consisting of only questions and the other consisting
of only answers, and allow you to open 2 Canvas tabs,
one for each so that you can read the questions on one
tab and answer on the other tab <span
style="color:red">WITHOUT</span> leaving
Canvas. Also, you must <span style="color:red">start both
parts</span>, i.e.
Questions and Answers, <span style="color:red">at the SAME
TIME</span>.</li>
	<li>The midterm exam will be proctored via a Zoom meeting (see
guidelines below) which <span style="color:blue">will be recorded</span>. In
order to take the midterm, <span style="color:blue">you
must be logged in</span> to the Zoom meeting.</li?

at 7pm. Please find the registration links below which are the same as the
main midterm.</li>

						<h3
style="margin-top:20px">Guidelines &amp; Regulations:</h3>
						<p>It is your responsibility
to make sure that you adhere to the following regulations. Failure to do so
may lead to your midterm exam being voided.
						</p>
						<ol>
	<li>First, join the assigned meeting (please check
<a
href="../midterm-zoom-meeting.html">HERE</a>)
using your UST account connected to
Zoom. Make sure that you join the meeting <span
style="color:red">50-minute before</span> the midterm
time so that we can check your student ID/HKID/passport and
to make sure that your configuration works fine.</li>
	<li>You must use <span style="color:red; text-decoration:underline;
font-weight:bold">two different devices</span> as follows:
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
		<li>A laptop/desktop that you will use to connect to
Canvas and take the midterm (note that the tablet/mobile version of
Canvas does not always function properly with Canvas).</li>
		<li>Another device (mobile phone/tablet/laptop/desktop)
that you will use to join the Zoom meeting.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Device (b) must have video and audio capabilities and you must
make sure that its camera clearly shows your face (at least partially),
your hands, and desk area
so that we can make sure you are working on the Canvas midterm on your own.
The screen of device (a) (i.e. the device where you are taking the Canvas
midterm) must also be visible. However, the camera does not need to show
your midterm input but just show enough to demonstrate thay the <span
style="color:blue">only
active window is Canvas</span>. See <a href="img/midterm-setup.png">here</a>
for an example
of "correct" configuration.</li>
	<li>If you have your camera turned off or not correctly configured,
you <span style="color:red">will not be allowed to take the midterm
and there will not be any make-up midterm for you.</span>
	<li>You are not allowed to access any other programs, applications,
browser tabs, or windows on device (a), except for the Canvas window for
taking the midterm. Keep in mind that Canvas tracks when you switch to a
different window, application, or tab and we will check this.</li>
	<li>While taking the midterm you must be alone in the room and no one
else should be with you. If you are unable to have access to such a room,
then you must inform the instructor of this at least two days before the
midterm, explain why this is not possible and state who else might be in the
room with you during the midterm.</li>
	<li>During the midterm, you may be asked to adjust your camera if it
is not well-placed or to show that you are the only person in the room so
make sure that you <span style="color:blue">have audio
turned on in device
(b)</span>, but <span style="color:blue">don't put on your
earphones or
headsets</span>.
During
the exam, you
must remain silent and are not allowed to communicate verbally,
electronically or in any other way with anyone, except for the
invigilator.</li>
	<li>If you have a question about the exam, you may
click "raise hand" button. Then, the invigilator would take
you to a breakout room and address the question through
verbal communications.
<!--you may use the chat
function of Zoom to communicate your question privately to the
invigilator.--></li>
	<li>You are allowed to have blank sheets of paper that you will use
for rough work.</li>

    	<h4>Lecture Attendance via Zoom</h4>
        <p>The lecture classes this semester will be
conducted in mixed-mode lite. The link for the meetings is
available under the "Schedule" section of this page and at
the Canvas page of the course <a
href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/38828">here</a>.
Before you join a meeting for the first time, visit <a
href="https://hkust.zoom.us/", target = _blank>this page</a> and sign in to Zoom using your HKUST e-mail, as our lecture meetings will require HKUST user authentication. When attending a lecture meeting,
	<ol>
	<li>Please rename yourself to:

        <br/><br/>
        <span style="color:red">LASTNAME Firstname studentusername</span> E.g., CHAN Wing Ho cwingho<br/><br/>
        </li>
    <li>During a Zoom meeting, please remain muted to
avoid interfering the class with sounds from your
background.</li>
	<li>You are highly recommended to ask question by
voice. To do that, please push the Raise Hand button, and
the instructor will then unmute you.</li>
	<li>You may also use the Chat function to post
questions or comments. Note that if there are too many
chats, the instructor may not be able to answer them
timely.</li>
	<li>We strongly recommend that you turn on your
camera with virtual background. It helps create a more
interactive online classroom experience.</li>
	</ol>
	If your have not used Zoom before, we suggest that
you try it out and get familiar with it before the first
lecture. You can find a good general set of guidelines
<a
href="http://cei.ust.hk/zoom-teaching-good-practices-and-faqs">here</a>.
		<br/><br/>

		<p>Zoom lecture videos will be published on the supplementary website (<a href="https://www.cse.ust.hk/~desmond/comp2012h/Password_Only/">https://www.cse.ust.hk/~desmond/comp2012h/Password_Only/</a>) after each lecture class depending on when they become available.

		  <p>Honesty and integrity are central to academic work.
You must observe and uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and
honesty in all the work (lab exercises, programming assignments, quiz,
exams, etc.) you do in this course. We deal with cheating cases seriously
and the maximum penalty is a FAIL in the course plus additional
disciplinary actions from the CSE Department as well as from the
University. Both the copier(s) and the copiee will be punished, and the
penalty will be more than just a zero mark in your assignments/exams.</p>

To get point for the lab, you
are requied to finish the requirement / program, and
submit it to the <a href="https://zinc.cse.ust.hk">ZINC (automatic grading system)</a> on or
before the deadline as stated on the lab page. Each lab is worth 1 point.

  		  <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Note to all students:</span><br/><br/>
                    The lab exercises are designed to help you learn a (new) programming language with on-the-spot advices of a teaching assistant. All the TAs assigned to the course are very experienced in C++ programming. It is more a service to you than an exercise for the marks. The 8% mark is only set to encourage you to make good use of the lab time.
  		  Although we don't expect you to finish the lab exercise before you attend the lab, we expect you to have
read the lab's materials and understand what you are required to do.

                       <li>Although we don't expect you to finish the lab exercise before you go to the lab, we expect you to have read the lab's materials and understand what you are required to do.</li>
                       <li>At the end of each lab, you are required to show and demonstrate your solution of the lab exercise to one of your TAs or a student helper. You may be also asked a question related to the lab to show that you really work out the solution yourself. No late lab assignment will be accepted. You must attend your enrolled lab to earn your credits.</li>

                        If a day is a public holiday, students are not required to attend the lab held on that day. There will be no points for the lab. Although a student may not need to attend a lab on a day that happens to be a public holiday, we strongly encourage the student to still go over the materials of that lab
                        and try to finish it. Labs help students review what they are taught in lectures and get ready for the next lab.

   		  <span style="font-weight:bold">[Public holiday exception]</span>
   		  <br/>
   		  If a day is a public holiday, students are not required
to attend the labs held on that day. There will be no points for these labs
for only those students who originally are supposed to attend these labs;
other students are not affected. As different students may be affected by
different public holidays, the final total lab points will be normalized
according to the number of labs a student has to take. However, although a
student may not need to attend a lab on a day that happens to be a public
holiday, we strongly encourage the student to still go over the materials
of that lab and try to finish it. Labs help students review what they are
taught in lectures and get ready for the next lab.
<br/><br/>
This policy will also apply to situations when classes/labs are cancelled
due to, e.g., adverse weather conditions, etc.

                  <h4 style="padding-top:5px">How hard should I work?</h4>
                  <br />
                  Some people say that a 3-unit course takes 8 hours/week. It all depends. You should cultivate an independent learning habit.<br />
                  <br />
                  Here is a guideline:<br />
                  <ul>
                     <li>pre-study (15 - 30 minutes): what topic/materials will the coming lecture be covering? </li>
                     <li>
                        attend class: The A+ students tell you that they pay FULL attention in class and try to understand everything in the class so that it is easy to review the class materials.
                        <ul>
                           <li>our notes provide a guideline; also take your own notes </li>
                           <li>ask questions whenever you don't understand<br />
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>post-study (3 hours): re-reading the notes, book reading<br />
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <h4 style="padding-top:5px">How do I learn a new programming language?</h4>
                  <br />
                  Learning a programming language is similar to learning a human language (like Chinese, English, French, etc.) but only easier. However, the basic technique is similar to the 3Rs:<br />
                  <ul>
                     <li>read more: we are not going to follow the recommended textbook vigorously, and we can't give all the details in our lectures. Read the book! <br />
                     </li>
                     <li>write more: there are only 3 programming assignments in this class. That is NOT enough! Think of problems around you and try to solve them by writing a computer   program.<br />
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h4 style="padding-top:5px">How can I write a program effectively?</h4>
                  <br />
                  You should spend a lot of time in THINKING (stay away from the computer) before you start WRITING. No matter how beautiful your codes are, if the method you use is wrong, they are still wrong codes.<br />
                  <br />
                  Here is a guideline:<br />
                  <ul>
                     <li>planning (30 - 40%) : algorithm design, code design, documentation </li>
                     <li>coding (60 - 70%) :  writing code, debugging, testing </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />
                  <h4 style="padding-top:5px">What operating system do I use to program for this class?</h4>
                  <br />
                  The labs will be conducted using the Windows operating system. However, we will be using the VS Code programming environment with the GCC
                  compiler. This is a multi-platform solution that you can set up on your PC, Mac, and Linux. For information on setting up VS Code, please refer to <a href="labs/vscode/">this page</a>.
                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <h4 style="padding-top:5px">Where may I get help on programming problems?</h4>
                  <br/>
                  God help those who help themselves! But if you can't find your God, try the following, in that order:<br/>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Email your question to your TAs. (We do most business using emails here in the university.) Please do not expect an answer right away. </li>
                     <li>Email your question to the instructor. </li>
                     <li>Don't expect the instructors and your TAs to be your debugger! Except for obvious bugs, we won't debug for you. </li>
                     <li>Find it on the Web.<br />
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />

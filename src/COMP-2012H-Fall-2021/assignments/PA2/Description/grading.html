                While there are multiple grading records on ZINC, only the latest one will count as the score for your submission; you can ignore other previous records.

                Since we did not mention how late penalty is calculated, we gave a grace period of 5 minutes to late submission. Your latest submission before 23 October 2021, 00:04 HKT was graded. If there were no submissions before 23 October 2021, 00:04 HKT, your score will be discarded. This applies to the bonus part as well.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Read the list of common errors (see below) and carefully understand the test cases and the solution.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No partial credits were given for each test-case.

                <li>
                  Send an email to the TA in-charge with the subject header "COMP2012H PA2 Grade Appeal".
                </li>
                <li>
                  State which test-case(s) you wish to appeal (refer to the list in the section below). Clearly state your reasoning for why your code should have passed those test-case(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                  You may propose changes to your source code. Attach your code snippet with the proposed changes in your email. However, such changes are subject to a grade deduction at the discretion of the TA in-charge, proportional to the magnitude of change, with a 3% deduction being the minimum.
                </li>
                <li>
                  DO NOT attach any .exe/executable file(s) in your email since we do not run your code outside ZINC.

                Below is a list of common errors and situations for COMP2012H assignments in general:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Uninitialized variables will have garbage (random) values in C++. Sometimes it will be 0, sometimes
                  it will not. In that case, your program may generate different results on different machines or
                  different runs if your logic depend on an uninitialized value. If you have assumed them to be 0 or
                  something specific (e.g. a very large value), your code is faulty and will get random results.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Retrieving values from deleted/unallocated dynamic memory, or index out-of-bounds, may not always
                  crash your program but may give random values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Compilation errors will result in 0 marks for this assignment. This should not occur as revealed
                  test cases were already provided to test your code on ZINC. Exceptions will only be given for
                  compilation errors that are the fault of the TA's testing code.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Runtime errors and crashes due to incorrect memory access, memory allocation, memory deallocation,
                  missing variable initialization, missing return values, out-of-bound array access, etc. may not
                  occur all the time on all machines. However, even though you may not encounter the error/crash when
                  you test your program, if your program crashes during any of the test cases on ZINC, the
                  corresponding test cases will be considered as incorrect and will receive 0 marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Runtime crashes due to the reasons above or due to timeouts (infinite loop / infinite recursion /
                  runtime taking too long) will only be regraded if you can debug, fix, and report it in your email
                  appeal with attached code snippet. The corresponding test-case(s) where the runtime crash occurred
                  will still be considered as incorrect and will receive 0 marks, but you can recover your marks for
                  the rest of the test-cases.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution code</strong>: <a href="./resources/solution/Commit.cpp">Commit.cpp</a>, <a href="./resources/solution/gitlite.cpp">gitlite.cpp</a></li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Grading package on ZINC</strong>: <a href="./resources/pa2-grading.zip">gitlite-grader.zip</a>
                </li>
              </ul>

              Notes for grading package:
              <ul>
                <li>The main difference of Gitlite of the grading package compared to the one you obtained from the skeleton code is that all filesystem operations are replaced by in-memory operations (See <code>FilesystemStub.cpp</code>).</li>
                <li>
                  To test it with your submission, extract this zip and copy your <code>Commit.cpp</code> and <code>gitlite.cpp</code> to this directory. Then run make:
                  <pre><code>
                    make
                  </code></pre>
                  Two executables are produced:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>gitlite-grader</code>: The grader version of Gitlite with all filesystem operations replaced by in-memory operations.</li>
                    <li><code>gitlite-unit-testing</code>: Unit testing cases of individiual functions.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  In this version, you need to run the test cases one-by-one (batch running is not available). For example,
                  <pre><code>
                    # For Windows
                    .\gitlite-grader -t tests/init.in

                    # For macOS and Linux
                    ./gitlite-grader -t tests/init.in
                  </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                  To run memory leak check, use <a href="./resources/grader-leak/Makefile">this Makefile</a> and follow the <a href="../../../assignments/PA2/Description/#memory-leak">instructions here</a>. The Makefile produces two additional executables:
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>gitlite-grader-leak</code>: The grader version of Gitlite with all filesystem operations replaced by in-memory operations. Also runs GCC sanitizer.</li>
                    <li><code>gitlite-unit-testing-leak</code>: Unit testing cases of individiual functions. Also runs GCC sanitizer.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

            <div class="card-footer text-muted">

                The following test cases of unit testing correspond to those listed in ZINC. You can run them by providing the test case number to <code>gitlite-unit-testing</code>. For example, this runs test case 10:
                <pre><code>

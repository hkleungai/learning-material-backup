<H1>My Bio</H1>

Hi, I'm Vina.  I don't know where I was born or who my parents were, though one was a tabby and 
one was a tortoiseshell cat.  When I was straying around, the <a href="http://www.spca.org.hk">SPCA</A> found me and 
put me up for adoption.  I have been living with a family at <a href="http://www.ust.hk">HKUST</A> since 1996.

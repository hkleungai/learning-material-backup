<BODY>
<H1>GNU Debugger (GDB) </H1>The GNU Debugger (gdb) is a freely available 
debugger for C, C++, and Fortran program compiler produced by the Free Software 
Foundation and is available for a wide range of computers. To use the GNU 
debugger (gdb) with C/C++ programs all the source code must be compiled with the 
"<CODE>-g</CODE>" debugger option that includes additional information in the 
excutable, allowing the debugger map the locations of memory address back into 
meaningful things like variable names and program line numbers. 
<DL>
  <DT><B><CODE>g++ -g -o file file.cpp</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Compiles the C++ program (file.cpp) with debugger option on 
  <DT><B><CODE>gdb file</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Starts GNU debugger (gdb) and loads the executable <CODE>file</CODE> into 
  memory. </DD></DL>Basic GNU debugger commands: 
<DL>
  <DT><B><CODE>quit</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Quits gdb and returns back to the user prompt. GDB may ask you if you want 
  to exit if the program being debugged was not completed executing. 
  <DT><B><CODE>run</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Starts the execution of the program being debugged. 
  <DT><B><I>control-c</I></B> 
  <DD>Interrupts the execution of the program being debugged. This is useful if 
  the program appears to be stuck in a loop. 
  <DT><B><CODE>where</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Shows where the program was stopped. A trace showing each active 
  function's argument list, the file that the function came from, and the next 
  line in the code that will be executed in the function is displayed. 
  <DT><B><CODE>up</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Moves up the trace to function that called the current function. 
  <DT><B><CODE>down</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Moves down the trace to function that is called by the current function. 
  <DT><B><CODE>print c</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Prints out value of the variable <CODE>c</CODE>. 
  <DT><B><CODE>print c+x</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Prints out value of the sum of the variables <CODE>c</CODE> and 
  <CODE>x</CODE>. Note that any regular C expression can be evaluated by 
  <CODE>print</CODE>. 
  <DT><B><CODE>list</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Show source code around place that program is currently stopped. 
  <DT><B><CODE>break #line-number</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Sets a breakpoint at the specified line number of the file. 
  <DT><B><CODE>break [file:]function</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Sets a breakpoint at the specified function of the file. 
  <DT><B><CODE>info breakpoints</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Show the status of user-settable breakpoints 
  <DT><B><CODE>clear </CODE></B>
  <DD>Removes the breakpoint 
  <DT><B><CODE>cont</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Continues the execution of a program after a control-c or a break point. 
  <DT><B><CODE>step</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Executes a single statement of program and returns to the debugger. 
  <DT><B><CODE>next</CODE></B> 
  <DD>Executes a subroutine and treats it as one instruction. debugger. 
</DD></DL></BODY>

<h3>Course Description</h3>
This course introduces the concepts, languages, techniques, and patterns for programming heterogeneous, massively parallel
processors such as the GPU and multicore CPUs. Specifically, we will cover heterogeneous computing architectures, data-parallel
programming models, techniques for memory bandwidth management, and parallel algorithm patterns. We will use CUDA C as the
main programming language.

<h3><a href="assign/assign_index.htm">Assignments</a></h3>
<h3>Workload and Grading</h3>
Tentatively lab attendance and exercise counts 20%, in-class quizzes 30%, and <a href = "assign/assign_index.htm">programming assignments</a> 50%. There will be no final exam.

<h3>Honor Code</h3>
All assignments should be done independently by individual students.  You can discuss among peers, but the handins should be your own work.
Plagiarism or assitance to plagiarism will be dealt with following <a href = "http://tl.ust.hk/integrity/student-1.html">university policy</a>.

<h3> Lab Resources</h3>
You can use Lab 4 (Rm 4210, Lift 19) inside or outside lab session hours. Alternatively, you can use any machine with
<a href = "http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-gpus">CUDA-enabled GPUs</a>, and download and install <a href = "http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-downloads">a current
version of the CUDA toolkit</a> on the machine.

Here is a list of <a href = "http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/nvidia-gpu-computing-documentation">CUDA
documentation from NVIDIA</a>.

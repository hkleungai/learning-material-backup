                        <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">In the lab session, we will use VSCode as the development platform for C++ programming. Please read the following tutorial which
						will help you get started:

                        <ul>

   						<li><a href="../labs/vscode/">VSCode installation and usage</a></li>

                        </ul>

						<br />

                        <p class="Title">Lab Policy</p>

                        <p><font color="red">Please use your FULL NAME (surname first, e.g., "CHAN, Tai Man") as shown on your student ID card to join the lab zoom meeting so that we can give you the lab score accordingly.</font></p>

                          <p><span class="Body" style="padding-bottom: 0pt; padding-top: 0pt; ">The lab exercises
						  are designed to help you learn a (new) programming language with on-the-spot advices of a
						  teaching assistant. All the TAs assigned to the course are supposed to be very experienced in C++ programming. It is more a service to you than an exercise for the marks. The 10% mark is only set to encourage you to make good use of the lab time.</span></p>

                          <p>Each lab carries 3 points in total.</p>

                          <ul>
                            <li>By attending a lab, a student gets 1 point for attendnace (but only if it is clear that the student does put in some effort).</li>
                            <li>By completing the lab exercise correctly and answering TAs' question (if there is a question) correctly, the student gets the remaining 2 more points.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>If a student is unable to finish the lab and demonstrate to the TA by the end of the lab, they can only get the attendance point. </p>

                          <p id="holiday"><strong>[Public holiday exception]</strong> <br/>
						  If a day is a public holiday, students are not required to attend the
						  labs held on that day. There will be no points for these labs for only those
						  students who originally are supposed to attend these labs; other students are not
						  affected. As different students may be affected by different public holidays,
						  the final total lab points will be normalized according to the number of labs a
						  student has to take. However, although a student may not need to attend a lab on a day
						  that happens to be a public holiday, we strongly encourage the student to still go
						  over the materials of that lab and try to finish it. Labs help students review what
						  they are taught in lectures and get ready for the next lab.

						  <br />
						  <br />
						  This policy will also apply to situations when classes/labs are cancelled due to,
						  e.g., adverse weather conditions, etc.
                          <br />
                          <br />
                          <span style="color:red;">When the public holiday policy is applied to a lab, you will see a blank instead of "0" on Canvas for your lab score of that lab. It means that item will be excluded from the overall lab average calculation for you.</span>

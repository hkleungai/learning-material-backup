  An annoucnemnt about the PA1's release has been made on Canvas. Please check.<br><br>
  Please note that we will use Canvas for all important announcements. You should, with default Canvas settings, receive an email notification for every announcment we make there. Please check your email inbox and Canvas regularly.

(Same announcement has been made on Canvas)
<br>
<br>
You will have your first lab session next week (Feb 14 - 18). The lab 1 description has been released on our course webpage under <a href="../web/labs.html">"Labs"</a>.
<br><br>
The lab zoom meeting links can be found under <a href="../web/schedule.html">"Course Info" -> "Schedule"</a> or Canvas.
<br><br>
Also a gentle heads-up: lab 1 is relatively easy, however, the labs will naturally become more and more difficult as the course progresses. For COMP2011, you are expected to read and prepare for the labs before you join your registered lab session. In fact, most students would have their lab tasks finished when they come so that they can demo and leave early. While the lab TAs will do their best to help those who are stuck after checking the early demos, you are highly recommended to prepare and seek for help early. We have set up zoom office hours on every day so that you can get help from anywhere on any weekday: <a href="../web/tas.html">"People" -> "TAs"</a> You can also post your questions on Piazza which can be accessed via Canvas. Note that while you shouldn't share/post your solution, you are welcome to discuss the ideas/techniques and get hints/clarifications there.
<br><br>
For exactly how the lab is conducted, the TAs will brief you about that at the beginning of the first lab session, so please be on time.
<br><br>
For VS Code setup, our TAs will also try to help in the first lab. If you couldn't get it set up yet, you may use any C++ online compiler for now, e.g., <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler">https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler</a> or <a href="http://cpp.sh/">http://cpp.sh/</a>
<br><br>
See you then!

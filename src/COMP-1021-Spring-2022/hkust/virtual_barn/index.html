            <li>The Virtual Barn is a service provided by HKUST
		which gives you access to Microsoft Windows through the web</li>
            	<ul>
		<li>It is available on Windows, Mac OS, Android and Apple iOS</li>
		<li>So you can run it on your laptop, tablet, and even your phone</li>
		</ul>

		<li>Sometimes it is very useful, so you are strongly recommended to install 
		 it on your machine</li>
		<li>Here are some ways in which it is useful:
		<ul>
		<li>It can give you a path to HKUST through the web 
		which works better for some users e.g. mainland students</li>
		<li>It can give you access to Windows which 
		already has Python installed, which you can use
			<ul>
			<li>As well as Python, you can use browsers and Microsoft Office programs such as Word and Excel</li>
			<li>Because the Virtual Barn is 'part of HKUST' after you get into the virtual barn 
			you don't have to worry 
			about HKUST authentication again</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

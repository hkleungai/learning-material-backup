    <h2>Marking Scheme</h2>

    <ol type="A">
		<li>Creating an integer random number (15 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>VBA function <tt>Randomize</tt> is used to initialize the random number generator (5 marks)</li>
				<li>The variable <tt>Target</tt> is set by an appropriate random number with a range of 1 to 100 (including 1 and 100)  (5 marks)</li>
				<li>Show a message box such as "I am thinking of a number..." (5 marks)</li>


			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>In the loop, get the input from the player (5 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>Show an input box to ask for an input number (5 marks)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>In the loop, checking the player's guess (25 marks)

			<ul>
				<li>Make sure the guessed number is in the range of 1 to 100 (5 marks)</li>
				<li>Show an appropriate error message if the range is lower than 1 or higher than 100 (5 marks)</li>
				<li>If the guessed number is higher than the player's random number,
						tell the player to try again with a lower number (5 marks)
				</li>
				<li>
					If the guessed number is lower than the player's random number,
					tell the player to try again with a higher number (5 marks)
				</li>
				<li>
						If none of the above conditions is correct, the guessed number will be the computer's random number,
						tell the player he/she has a correct guess (5 marks)
				</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<li>Counting the number of guesses (15 marks)
			<ul>
				<li>The variable <tt>NumberOfGuesses</tt> is initialized as 0 (5 marks)</li>
				<li>The variable <tt>NumberOfGuesses</tt> is increased by 1 every time a guess is made (5 marks)</li>
				<li>Show the total number of guesses when the game is over (5 marks)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Showing the game history in Excel cells (30 marks)
			<ul>


				<li>The variable <tt>CurrentRow</tt> is initialized to 2 (5 marks)</li>
				<li>For each guess, show the guess number in an appropriate row in column A (5 marks)</li>
				<li>For each guess, show the response message in an appropriate row in column B (10 marks)</li>
				<li>The <tt>CurrentRow</tt> variable should increase by 1 every time after writing (10 marks)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Clearing the worksheet before each game (10 marks)

				<ul>
					<li>Starting from row 2, clear a suitable number of row in columns A and B in order to remove the past game history
						<ul>

						<li>In the lab, <tt>Range("A2:B102").ClearContents</tt> is recommended</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

		</li>
		<li>
			Enter your name and student ID number somewhere at/near the top of column C. In the lab, Cell <tt>C1</tt> is recommended
			<ul>
				<li>This is your statement that the work is yours</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2 name="late_policy" id="late_policy">Late Submission Policy</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>If you submit late, it causes us a lot of trouble, so please don't do that </li>
		<li>The submission link won't work after your lab deadline</li>
		<li>If you are late, you will have to send your work in an email to <strong>cspeter@cse.ust.hk</strong>
			with a suitable email title such as "COMP1022Q Late Lab Submission"</li>
		<li>Each lab project is given a mark out of 100</li>

		<li>At least 20 marks will be deducted if you submit late </li>
		<li>
			For every 12 hours (or part of that) you are late, 20 marks are deducted. For example,

			<ul>
				<li>If you are late for 1 second, 20 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>If you are late for 11 hours and 59 minutes, 20 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>If you are late for 12 hours and 1 minute, 40 marks will be deducted</li>
				<li>and so on</li>
			</ul>

If you already know C and C++ well before coming to this class,
you will find this class easy (and perhaps boring).
<p>
Then, this optional, difficult project is for you!! As an
incentive, if you successfully complete this optional project,
your final letter grade can be shot up, up to 2 sub-grades
(e.g. B+ to A).
However, even you choose to work on this project,
you still, and must, finish all lab assignments,
which is the course requirement.
<p>
However, it is a difficult and great challenge. Hence I make
this an optional requirement.
This is, there is NO penalty or mark deduction if you opt
not to do this project.
This is only for highly self-motivated students.
<p>
Unlike lab assignments, I will <b>not</b> give a step-by-step
guide. I will give you much freedom in terms of implementation.
You are the boss of your project.
So, this project will be very interesting, and you should learn
a lot from it.

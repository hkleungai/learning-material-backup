COMP2021 is an intereting course. It mainly introduces some basic knowledge about unix and script programming. Through this course I get to know something about unix geek culture culture.

For example, there is a "war" simply about choices of editors, vi or emacs. Seems that endless debate goes on upon their advatanges, disdvantages. This actually sounds pretty religious.

In general, vi is faster, but with emacs, almost everything you want to do can be done there. They are both good editors in unix.

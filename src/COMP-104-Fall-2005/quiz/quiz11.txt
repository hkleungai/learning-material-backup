Linked Lists

1.	The following function is supposed to delete the first node in an integer linked list. What is wrong?

	void delHead(NodePtr Head){
        	Head = Head->next;
	}



2. 	The following function is supposed to delete an element deldata in an unsorted integer linked list. What is wrong?

	void del(NodePtr Head, int deldata){
        	NodePtr prev, cur = Head;
        	while(cur!=NULL  &&  deldata != cur->data){
			prev = cur;
			cur = cur->next;
        	}
        	prev->next = cur->next;
        	delete cur;
	}



Answer 1:	
	1. If Head is NULL, then "Head->next" will be illegal memory access.
	2. Need to use pass by reference to change Head
	3. Need to call delete on the deleted node

	void delHead(NodePtr& Head){
        	NodePtr cur = Head;
        	if(Head!=NULL){
			Head = Head->next;
			delete cur;
        	}
	}

Answer 2:	
	1. Need to pass Head by reference in case it is changed. 
	2. Need to test if list is NULL
	3. Need to see if deldata was not found.
	4. Need to add special code if deleted node is Head node:

	void del(NodePtr& Head, int deldata){
        	ptrType prev, cur = Head;
        	while(cur!=NULL  &&  deldata != cur->data){
			prev = cur;
			cur = cur->next;
        	}
        	if(cur==NULL){
			cout << "Error: " << deldata << " not in list!" << endl;
			return;
        	}
        	if(cur==Head)
			Head = Head->next;
		else
			prev->next = cur->next;
        	delete cur;
	}

<p>Assignment 0 is a test trial. The aim of this trial is to make sure the
Assignment Collecting System (ACS) is functioning all right and help you get
familiar with the procedure through which you submit your homework.</p>

<h3>DUE DATE</h3>

<p>The deadline of the assignment is 12:00 noon, Wed 25 Sep 2002. Late
assignments will not be accepted, since ACS will not collect them.</p>

<h3>WHAT ARE YOU REQUIRED TO DO?</h3>
For Assignment 0, please pay attention to the following information:
<ol>
  <li>The name of the assignment, i.e., a0.</li>
  <li>Specification of the assignment. In a0, you are required to write a
    program to create a text file "test.txt" and write the string "This is a
    test." into it. Please use "mytest" as the filename for your .h and .cpp
    files.</li>
</ol>

<h3>YOU NEED A CS UNIX ACCOUNT.</h3>
You must use your UNIX account to submit your homework. Please make sure that
you have activated this account. If you have not, you can do it in the
CSSystem home page (<a
href="https://cssu3.cs.ust.hk:8443/pass.html">https://cssu3.cs.ust.hk:8443/pass.html</a>).

<h3>HOW DO YOU SUBMIT YOUR WORK?</h3>
For Assignment 0, you should do the following to submit your homework:
<ol>
  <li>Create your homework directory "~/comp171/a0/" under your UNIX
  account.</li>
  <li>Put your files "mytest.cpp" and "mytest.h" under your homework
    directory before the deadline.
    <ul>
      <li>Please name your files exactly as specified, i.e. "mytest.cpp"and
        "mytest.h".</li>
      <li>In a0, perhaps you don't think the file "mytest.h" is necessary. In
        that case, you may leave the file empty.</li>
      <li>You are encouraged to compile and run your program to check if it
        gives the right result, but please send me only the files
        "mytest.cpp" and "mytest.h".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Although a0 is a test assignment, please remember to submit your work
before the deadline and it will account for 10 points in your final score. If
you have any questions about the assignment, please send emails to <a

<h3>Course Description</h3>
[Previous Course Code(s): COMP 251] Comparative studies of programming languages, programming language concepts and constructs. Non-imperative programming paradigms: object-oriented, functional, logic, concurrent programming. Basic concepts of program translation and interpretation. Storage allocation and run-time organization. Prerequisite(s): COMP 151/151H (prior to 2009-10) and COMP 171/171H (prior to 2009-10); or COMP 2012/2012H.

<h3>Topics</h3>
This course will cover functional programming in Standard ML (SML), language parsing in FLEX and BISON, logic programming in PROLOG, and GPU parallel programming in CUDA. The concepts about programming languages include language constructs, grammar representation, program translation and interpretation, storage allocation and run-time organization.

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
On successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to:
<p>
(1)	Utilize context-free grammars to identify and define the formal syntax of programming languages.
<p>
(2)	Apply general tools such as Bison and Flex to construct a parser for a language defined by a context-free grammar.
<p>
(3)	Identify the general constructs and concepts used in implementing programming languages, particularly those in function activation and parameter passing methods.
<p>
(4)	Differentiate the alternative programming paradigms of functional and logic programming, and write programs in a language selected from each of the two paradigms (e.g. SML and Prolog).

<h3>Exams</h3>
There are a midterm exam</a> and a final exam.  Both exams are closed-book, closed-notes. The final exam is accumulative, covering all course material with emphasis on <b>post-midterm</b> topics.
<p>
Past midterm exams:
<a href = "exams/fall2013_midterm.pdf">Fall 2013</a> and <a href = "exams/fall2013_midterm_solution.txt">solution</a>,
<a href = "exams/fall2012_midterm.pdf">Fall 2012</a> and <a href ="exams/fall2012_midterm_solution.txt">solution</a>,
<a href = "exams/fall2011_midterm.pdf">Fall 2011</a> and <a href = "exams/fall2011_midterm_solution.txt">solution</a>.

<p>
Past final exams:
<a href = "exams/fall2013_final_solution.pdf">Fall 2013</a>,
<a href = "exams/fall2012_final_solution.pdf">Fall 2012</a> and
<a href = "exams/fall2011_final_solution.pdf">Fall 2011</a>

<h3>Grading</h3>
Three programming assignments each count for 10%, the midterm exam 30%, and the final exam 40% of the overall grade.
<p>
All assignments should be done independently by individual students.  You can discuss among peers, but the handins should be your own work. Plagiarism or assitance to plagiarism will be dealt with following university policy.
<p>
No late handins will be accepted.
<p>
Skipping the midterm or final exam without prior approval or proper documentation (e.g., doctor's certificate for sickness on the exam day) results in a failing grade automatically.

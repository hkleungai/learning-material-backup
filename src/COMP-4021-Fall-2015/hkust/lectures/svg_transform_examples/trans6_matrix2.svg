     This image uses the matrix attribute to do three 
     operations at once. A matrix can 
     be used to do many operations in one matrix.
     This is faster than doing a number of separate 
     operations.

     For this demo the required operations are

     	- move shape from (x1,y1) to origin [For this demo x1=150, y1=100]
     	- rotate shape 30 degrees
     	- move shape to new position (x2,y2) [For this demo x2=200, y2=100]

     Written in matrix form the three operations are as follows:

        [ 1 0 x2]   [cos(a) -sin(a) 0]   [ 1 0 -x1]  
        [ 0 1 y2] * [sin(a)  cos(a) 0] * [ 0 1 -y1] 
        [ 0 0 1 ]   [  0       0    1]   [ 0 0  1 ] 

     This is equivalent to:

   	[cos(a) -sin(a) -x1cos(a) + y1sin(a) + x2]
	[sin(a)  cos(a) -x1sin(a) - y1cos(a) + y2]
	[  0       0               1             ]

     So the SVG matrix can be written as 

	transform = "matrix(cos(a), sin(a), -sin(a), cos(a), -x1cos(a)+y1sin(a)+x2, -x1sin(a)-y1cos(a)+y2)"

    The last two parameters:
    -x1cos(a)+y1sin(a)+x2 = -150*cos(30 degrees)+100*sin(30 degrees)+200
    = 120.096189432
    -x1sin(a)-y1cos(a)+y2 = -150*sin(30 degrees)- 100*cos(30 degrees)+100
    = -61.6025403784

     Which evaluates to

	transform = "matrix(0.866, 0.5, -0.5, 0.866, -129.9 +50 +200, -75 -86.6 + 100 )"

     Which is

	transform="matrix(0.866 0.5 -0.5 0.866 120.1 -61.6 )"

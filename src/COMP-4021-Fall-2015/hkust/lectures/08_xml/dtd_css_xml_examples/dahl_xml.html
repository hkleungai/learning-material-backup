<Autobiography>
<Title>Boy  Tales of Childhood</Title> 
<Description>
"Boy" is a fascinating memoir of Roald Dahl's childhood. Dahl shares his
stories about his family, life at school and his first job. One of the most
intriguing aspects of this book is that you can see the real events and
preoccupations that shaped Dahl's fiction writing. As Anne Faundez writes in
Junior Education, "His delight in the sweet shop and in chocolate bars, his
fascination with flying, his interest in nature and his brush with bullying and
corporal punishment are just some of the personal experiences with stayed
with him and which he wove into his stories." The book features many
black-and-white photos and extracts from letters in Roald Dahl's own
handwriting. </Description>

<Title>Going Solo</Title> 
<Description>
"Going Solo" is a memoir which picks up where "Boy" leaves off with Roald
on his way to East Africa to take up a job with the Shell Oil Company in Dar
es Salaam. Dahl is in Africa when World War II breaks out and he leaves
Shell to join up with the RAF. This book details Dahl's wartime exploits, which
include having a luger pointed at his head by the leader of a German convoy,
crash-langing in no-man's land (and sustaining injuries that entailed having
his nose pulled out and shaped!) and even surviving a direct hit during the
Battle of Athens, when he was sufficiently recovered to fly again, this time in
Hurricanes. The book features black-and-white photos, as well as maps,
telegrams and other memorabilia.

<Title>The BFG</Title> 
<Description>
When orphan Sophie is snatched from her bed by a Giant, she fears that he's
going to eat her. But although he carries her far away to Giant Country, the
Giant has no intention of harming her. As he explains, in his unique way of
talking, "I is the only nice and jumbly Giant in Giant Country! I is THE BIG
FRIENDLY GIANT! I is the BFG." The BFG tells Sophie how he mixes up
dreams to blow through a trumpet into the rooms of sleeping children. But
soon, all the BFG's powers are put to the test as he and Sophie battle to stop
the other Giants from tucking into the children of the world. The RAF and
even the Queen become involved in the mission.

<Title>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</Title> 
<Description>
For the first time in a decade, Willy Wonka, the reclusive and eccentric
chocolate maker, is opening his doors to the public... well, five members of
the public to be exact. The lucky five who find a Golden Ticket in their Wonka
chocolate bars will receive a private tour of the factory, given by Mr. Wonka
himself. For young Charlie Bucket, this a dream come true. And, when he
finds a dollar bill in the street, he can't help but buy two Wonka's
Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delights - even though his
impoverished family could certainly use the extra dollar for food. But as
Charlie unwraps the second chocolate bar, he sees the glimmer of gold just
under the wrapper! The very next day, Charlie, along with his unworthy fellow
winners Mike Teavee, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Augustus Gloop,
steps through the factory gates to discover whether or not the rumors
surrounding the Chocolate Factory and its mysterious owner are true. What
they find is that the gossip can't compare to the extraordinary truth, and for
Charlie, life will never be the same again. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,
another unforgettable masterpiece from the legendary Roald Dahl, never fails
to delight, thrill, and utterly captivate.

<Short-Story-Collection>
<Title>Skin and Other Stories</Title> 
<Description>
Who could imagine that a woman might use a frozen leg of lamb to kill her
husband -  and then feed it to the investigating police? Or that a greedy group
of art dealers would stop at nothing to separate a poor man from a valuable
picture - that's tattooed on his back?
These thirteen tales will keep readers spellbound from the opening lines until
the surprise-twist endings that are always immensely satisfying. Roald Dahl
is one of the few authors ever to be so hugely successful as an author for
both children and adults. He was a master of the adult short story and his
popular anthologies showcase his skill as a sleight of hand artist. The stories
in this new collection have been specially selected as an introduction for
teenagers to the adult writings of one of the greatest storytellers ever.

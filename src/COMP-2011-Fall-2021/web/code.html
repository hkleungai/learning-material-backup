Honesty and integrity are central to academic work.
You must observe and uphold the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty in all the work (lab exercises,
programming assignments, quiz, exams, etc.) you do in this course.
We deal with cheating cases seriously and the maximum penalty is a FAIL in the course plus additional disciplinary actions from
the CSE Department as well as from the University. Both the copier(s) and the copiee will be punished, and the penalty will be
more than just a zero mark in your assignments/exams.

                          <li>Anyone &mdash; both the copier and the copiee &mdash; caught cheating on their assignments will get zero marks for the assignment. In
                                addition, they BOTH will get an additional 5% deduction from the <strong>final grade</strong> for the first time of cheating and an
				additional 10% deduction for the second time (i.e., for a total of 5%+10% = 15% deduction). Anyone get caught for cheating in an assignment
				for the 3rd time will get an immediate FAIL grade.<br />

                        If you are not sure what is considered plagiarism, here is a list of things you should NOT do:
                        <ul>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT copy program codes from another student/person. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT look at the actual program codes of another student. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT share actual program codes with other students/people (by paper, emails, blogs, FB, Google Doc, etc.). </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT give your program codes to other students who ask for it, and do not ask for a copy of their code either. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT post your program codes anywhere online. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> Do NOT leave your finished/unfinished program codes unattended. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> While we encourage discussion among students, you have to write codes on your own. </font> </li>
                          <li> <font color="red"> During discussion, you should NOT go to the details such that everyone will end up in the same code. </font> </li>
                        </ul>
						The list is by no means exhaustive, and you will need to use your own discretion.

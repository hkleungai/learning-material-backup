                          <br />
                          Some people say that a 3-unit course takes   8 hours/week. It all depends. You   should cultivate an independent   learning habit.<br />
                          <br />
                          Here is a guideline:<br />
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>pre-study (15 - 30 minutes) :   what topic/materials will the coming lecture be covering? </li>
                          <li>attend class: The A+ students   tell you that they pay FULL attention in class and try to understand everything   in the class so that it is easy to review the class materials.
                            <ul>
                              <li>our notes provide a guideline; also take your own notes </li>
                              <li>ask questions whenever you don't understand<br />
                              </li>
                            </ul>
                          </li>
                          <li>post-study (3 hours):   re-reading the notes, book reading<br />
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br />

                        <span class="subTitle">How do I   learn a new programming language?</span><br />
                        <br />
                        Learning a programming   language is similar to learning a human language (like Chinese, English, French,   etc.) but only easier. However, the basic technique is similar to the 3Rs:<br />
                        <ul>
                          <li>read more: we are not going to   follow the recommended textbook vigorously, and we can't give all the details in   our lectures. Read the book! <br />
                          </li>
                          <li>write more: there are only 3 programming assignments in this class. That is NOT enough! Think of   problems around you and try to solve them by writing a computer   program.<br />
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><span class="subTitle">How can I write a program   effectively?</span><br />
                        <br />
                        You should spend a lot of time in THINKING (stay away from the computer)   before you start WRITING. No matter how beautiful your codes are, if the method   you use is wrong, they are still wrong codes.<br />
                        <br />
                        Here is a guideline:<br />

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>planning (30 - 40%) : algorithm   design, code design, documentation </li>
                          <li>coding (60 - 70%) :  writing   code, debugging, testing </li>
                        </ul>

                        <!-- <span class="subTitle">What operating system do I use to program for this   class?</span><br />
                        <br />
                        The labs will be conducted using the Windows operating system. However, we will be using the Eclipse programming environment with the GCC
						compiler. This is a multi-platform solution that you can set up on your PC, Mac, and Linux. For information on setting up Eclipse, please refer to <a href="../labs/eclipse_intro/">this page</a>.

                          <br />
                          God help those who help themselves! But if you can't find your God,   try the following, in that order:<br />
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Post your question to the COMP2011 <a href="../forum.html">forum</a>. Your question &mdash; even you   think it may be a dumb question &mdash; usually is also the question of your fellow   classmates. Your TAs will read messages in the newsgroup too and answer your   question. Furthermore, other classmates will read your question and may also   answer it. <br />
                          </li>
                          <li>Email your question to your   TAs. (We do most business using   emails here in the university.) Pls do not expect an answer right away. </li>
                          <li>Email your question to me. </li>
                          <li>Don't expect me and your TAs to be your debugger! Except for obvious bugs, I   won't debug for you. </li>
                          <li>Find it on the Web.<br />
                          </li>

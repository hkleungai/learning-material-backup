Lab 1 has been released on our course webpage under "Labs".
<br><br>
Future labs are scheduled to be released at every Wednesday noon in the week before they will be held.
<br><br>
For the first lab, please join the corresponding group according to whether the last digit of your student ID number is odd (1,3,5,7,9) or even (0,2,4,6,8). For example, if your student ID is 20202429, then you should join the Odd group because 9 is odd. We may do some adjustment after the add/drop period.
<br><br>
The lab zoom meeting links will be posted on Canvas and the "Schedule" section of our course webpage before Monday.
<br><br>
Our TAs will start holding office hours next week. Meeting links and times will be posted at the TA page also before Monday.
<br><br>
We will have an online quiz on Sept 30th (Wednesday) 8:00pm - 8:30pm. Please mark it on your calendar.

  There will be another additional class for lecture sections, L3, L4 and L5:
  <ul>
    <li>For L3/L4/L5 only: Sep 17th (Fri) 8pm - 9:30pm  (Zoom link: <a href="https://hkust.zoom.us/j/96876782484?pwd=c2xqZlhaSDRHRDlJc0tBWC9XU0ozUT09">https://hkust.zoom.us/j/96876782484?pwd=c2xqZlhaSDRHRDlJc0tBWC9XU0ozUT09</a>)</li>

<div class="ai">
  <strong> <font color="#0174DF">2021-09-08<br /> </font> </strong>
  (The same annuncement has been made on Canvas)
<br><br>
You will have your first lab session early next week (either Sep 13th or 14th). The lab 1 description has been released on our course webpage under "Labs": https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/web/labs.html
<br><br>
The lab zoom meeting links can be found under "Course Info" -> "Schedule": https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/web/schedule.html
<br><br>
Also a gentle heads-up: lab 1 is relatively easy, however, the labs will naturally become more and more difficult as the course progresses. For COMP2011, you are expected to read and prepare for the labs before you join your registered lab session. In fact, most students would have their lab tasks finished when they come so that they can demo and leave early. While the lab TAs will do their best to help those who are stuck after checking the early demos, you are highly recommended to prepare and seek for help early. We have set up zoom office hours on every day so that you can get help from anywhere on any weekday: https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/web/tas.html You can also post your questions on Piazza which can be accessed via Canvas. Note that while you shouldn't share/post your solution, you are welcome to discuss the ideas/techniques and get hints/clarifications there.
<br><br>
For exactly how the lab is conducted, the TAs will brief you about that at the beginning of the first lab session, so please be on time. 
<br><br>
For VS Code setup, our TAs will also try to help in the first lab. If you couldn't get it set up yet, you may use any C++ online compiler for now, e.g., https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler or http://cpp.sh/
<br><br>
See you then!

As we have announced previously via emails, given the current situation with full online mode continuing and the complexities associated with conducting the online exam, we have decided to replace the midterm exam by a smaller programming assignment 4. An online final exam is still scheduled to take place at the end of the semester as originally planned. The percentage given to the labs (10%) and first programming assignment that was already handed out (8%) will not be changed. The updated grading scheme is now on this page: <a href="https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/web/gradingScheme.html ">https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2011/web/gradingScheme.html </a>
<br><br>
You are also once again reminded to check your emails and Canvas regularly for future announcements. Thanks for your attention.
</p>


<p class="ai">
<strong> <font color="#0174DF">2020-02-23<br /> </font> </strong>
For labs, students are divided into two groups according to whether the last digit of their student IDs is odd or even.
<br><br>
For example, if you student ID is 20309874, you are in the Even ID Group since the last digit 4 is even. To join the lab, you can use the links on our course webpage's schedule section or the <a href="https://canvas.ust.hk/courses/29836">Canvas</a> frontpage.
<br><br>
Please note that you must attend the lab session (and group) to which you are officially enrolled. If you need to temporarily swap to another session for a week with a good reason, you need to get an instructor's approval.
<br><br>
The first lab is optional, but you are encouraged to attend it so that you can get familiar with the demo procedure in Zoom. It won't take much time and you are free to go anytime after the demo.
</p>

<p class="ai">
<strong> <font color="#0174DF">2020-02-19<br /> </font> </strong>
The tentative midterm date and time is Apr 15th (Wed) 7:30pm-9:30pm. Please mark it on your calendar.
<br>Please also note that there is no lab and office hour this week. They will start next week.

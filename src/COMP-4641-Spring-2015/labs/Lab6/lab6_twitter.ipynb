      "\n",
      "Now we are ready to play with Twitter API. Before that, we will talk about [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth). \n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you just develop a game based on twitter and would like to share with your friends. To retrieve twitter-related information, you may just input your username and password to access the API. This might work fine for you, but your friend or colleague probably wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable inputing plain text username and password in your application. After all, who knows whether your application is doing something strange behind? Even you are trusted by them, it's never a good idea to store password in plain text as once your application is cracked they will be all leaked. Therefore, we need a way for *authorization* without giving up our credentials. \n",
      "\n",
      "OAuth is designed to cope with these situations. OAuth stands for \"Open Authorization\". It specifies a process for resource owners (your friend) to authorize third-party (your application) access to their server resources (twitter user name, bio, following etc.) without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some useful terms: \n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Third Party Applications: or `client`. For example, your game. \n",
      "    2. HTTP Service: or simply service. For example, twitter. \n",
      "    3. Resource owner: the user of your application. \n",
      "    4. Authorization server: the server of HTTP service that's in charge of authorization. \n",
      "    5. Resource server: the server of HTTP service that stores user information. \n",
      "    \n",
      "Note that authorization server and resource server can be the same machine, or not, or a distributed data farm. \n",
      "\n",
      "The protocol flow of OAuth is demonstrated in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)\n",

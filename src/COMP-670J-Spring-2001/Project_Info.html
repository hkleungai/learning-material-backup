<h1>
Fall Semester&nbsp; 2001 -- Class Project Info</h1></center>

<p><br>
<p><font size=+1>As previously discussed, this class will require&nbsp;
completing one medium-size project. The project will be worth 50% of the
final grade (not 40% as written&nbsp; in the tentative grading scheme proposed
at the beginning of the&nbsp; semester).&nbsp; Below you will find a list
of possible projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some&nbsp; of the projects are recommended
for one person while others are recommended for a one/two&nbsp; or two/three
person group.&nbsp; (The number of persons recommended for the project
is in parenthesis after the project title).</font>
<p><font size=+1>This project list is not meant to be exhaustive.&nbsp;
If you would like to do a project that is not on the list, e.g.,&nbsp;
implementing an algorithm we did not learn that is described in one of
the class references or reading a&nbsp; paper and implementing its contents,&nbsp;
please send&nbsp;&nbsp; email with a description of what you&nbsp; propose
to do or come and see me; we can discuss what would be an appropriate workload.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Since the class is so large I expect many different individuals
to be working on the same project.&nbsp; When this happens <i>your work
should be your own</i>. Please do not copy code or ideas from anyone else
except your partner (if you are on a two/three&nbsp; person project).</font>
<p><font size=+1>Also,&nbsp; only seven individuals/groups will be permitted
to work on any one project.&nbsp; The projects will be allocated on a first-come
first serve basis;&nbsp; the first seven to request a project get to work
on it.</font>

<h2>
<u>Project FAQ:</u></h2>
<font size=+1>The <a href="670PROJ_FAQ.html">Project
FAQ</a> will be updated regularly with tips and answers to some of the</font>
<br><font size=+1>common questions being asked.&nbsp; It is recommended
that you check it every few days</font>
<br><font size=+1>or so to see what has been added.</font>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b><u><font size=+1>Deadlines:</font></u></b>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1><b>November 23,&nbsp; 2001:&nbsp; </b>By this date you should
send me email at <i>golin@cs.ust.hk </i>with your first and second choice
for a project.&nbsp; Your email should include your name, ID number,&nbsp;
email address and first and second choices for the project. If you want
to work on a project not on the list please contact me before the deadline
to discuss your proposal.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<font size=+1><b>December 3,&nbsp; 2001:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>By
this date you should&nbsp; email me a short description of how you will
generate the data upon which you will test the performance of your program.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>December 22,&nbsp; 2001:&nbsp;</font></b><font size=+1>
Hand in your project by 11:00 AM.&nbsp; (Details of where, to be provided
later).</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<u><font size=+1>Notes:</font></u></h2>
<font size=+1>When you complete your project you should hand in two things;the
first will be a disk with your code on it. This includes both the algorithm
code and&nbsp; programs for generating test data.&nbsp; The second will
be a short printed report that contains the following information:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<font size=+1>A list of all of the files on your disk, a short description
of what they do and how to use them.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The address of a publically accessible directory where the
source and executable versions of the files are available so that I can
test out your programs on line.&nbsp; The directory should contain a README
file describing its contents.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1><b>Comparison Data:&nbsp;</b> Each project requires you to
compare your programs' solutions&nbsp; to each other and sometimes to the
optimum solution of a linear program.&nbsp; Prior to December 3,&nbsp;
2001 you should decide on how you will generate the data on which you will
test your algorithms and send me a short email describing this process.&nbsp;
I'll let you know if it's sufficient.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1><b>Shortcomings:</b>&nbsp; Please describe the situations
in which your program fails or becomes useless and explain why this happens.&nbsp;
For example,&nbsp; the PTAS for&nbsp; minimum makespan becomes slower and
slower as the approximation factor approaches 1.&nbsp; Please explain at
what approximation factor&nbsp; your algorithm will become useless and
justify your explanation.</font></li>
</ol>
<font size=+1>Finally,&nbsp; many of the projects require solving linear
programs. These linear programs are relatively simple and small, so any
general purpose LP package will be able to solve them. There are a&nbsp;
variety of linear programming packages available off of the web.&nbsp;
The book,&nbsp; <i>Numerical Recipes in C, </i>also has some good basic
code for solving LPs.&nbsp; For those of you doing projects requiring solving
LPs, please feel free to share this code among yourselves;&nbsp; solving
the LPS is only a subroutine and is not intended to be the bottleneck of
your project.</font>

<u><font size=+1>Projects:</font></u></h2>
<font size=+1>I/O Specifications for all of the projects can be found
<a href="ProjectIO.ps">here</a>.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1><i>MaxSat: </i>(1/2&nbsp; person)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implement
the Random (1/2-biased coin) algorithm, Randomized Rounding and the Best

algorithm calculating the exact solution. Compare the solutions given by
the two approximation algorithms to each other and to the exact solution.
You may assume that the input vertices will be points in the plane and
that the weight of the edge connecting two points will be the physical
distance between them. <i>Note:&nbsp; </i>the major work in this project
will involve implementing the Minimum-Spanning-Tree and Minimum-Weighted-Matching
code that&nbsp;&nbsp; are required as subroutines.</font></li>

<br>&nbsp;

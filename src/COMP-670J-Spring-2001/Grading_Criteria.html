<h1>
<u>Grading Criteria for the COMP670J project</u></h1>
<font size=+1>The project was graded on three criteria</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<font size=+1>The Report -- 40 pts :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes how
you designed your project and how understandable your report was.&nbsp;
The baseline grade for this was 30.&nbsp; That is,&nbsp; if you did the
minimal amount required you received 30 pts. More points were awarded for
extra work done or extra analysis</font></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<font size=+1>The Code&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 40 pts:&nbsp;&nbsp; This graded how
understandable and well designed your code was. Again,&nbsp; the baseline
grade was 30 points which was awarded for minimal code that worked.&nbsp;
More points were awarded for `better' code.&nbsp; The rule of thumb here
was that if I couldn't read your code and&nbsp; understand it you only
received 30 points.</font></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>
<font size=+1>&nbsp;Does it run? -- 20 points:&nbsp;&nbsp; 20 points were
given if your code ran. Everyone got full marks for this.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><br><font size=+1>Note that using these criteria the minimal grade for
a&nbsp; working program and basic report was an 80.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;

<h1>
<u>Grading Criteria for the Final COMP670J Mark</u></h1>

<p><br><font size=+1>The homeworks were worth 50% of the final grade.</font>
<br><font size=+1>The project was also worth 50% of the final grade.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Since the homeworks contained a total of 40 points the
formula for the final raw grade was therefore</font>
<center><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Final = (HW1 + HW2 + HW3 + HW4)*5/4&nbsp; + Project/2</font></center>
<font size=+1>The correspondence to final marks used the following table:</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>95 &lt;= Final&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A+</font>
<br><font size=+1>90 &lt;= Final &lt; 95&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</font>
<br><font size=+1>88 &lt;= Final &lt; 90&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-</font>
<br><font size=+1>85 &lt;= Final &lt; 88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B+</font>
<br><font size=+1>80 &lt;= Final &lt; 85&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</font>
<br><font size=+1>73 &lt;= Final &lt; 80&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B-</font>
<br><font size=+1>70 &lt;= Final &lt; 73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C+</font>
<br><font size=+1>65 &lt;= Final &lt; 70&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Final &lt; 65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>Finally,&nbsp; students whose grades were just below one
of the cutoffs and had solved some of the extra credit problems were `jumped'
one grade level.&nbsp; (The definition of `just below' depended upon how
much extra-credit had been given).</font>

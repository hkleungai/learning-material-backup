<LI>How the homework be graded?
<br><I>HW1 is worth 100 points total. The items will will look for are:
<br>Documentation:	20%
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Good program overview
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	Reasonable algorithm
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Comments for each var. declaration
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Comments for each code segment
<br>Indentation:  	10% 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  	We want good, clear, and consistent indentation
<br>Output Formatting:	20%
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Make your output look like our example output
<br>Program Correctness: 50%	
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should allow the Titanic to move correctly.  
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should move icebergs correctly. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Program should place islands and cargo correctly.
</I>
	
<LI>What do you mean by iceberg "hides" behind the cargo?
<br><I>Only the number of the cargo is displayed if they are in the same sqaure. The "I" of the iceberg "hides" behind the number of the cargo.
</I>

<LI>Also for cargoes, are they always visible?
<br><I>Yes. 
</I>

<LI>For cargoes, again, can they occupy the same square? If yes, which number/value should I display? For example, what if two cargoes, one "3" and the other "7", occupy the same square?
<br><I>Yes. Does not matter which value you decide to display. Pick either one.
</I>

<LI>Will the cargos move throughout the game?
<br><I>No, the cargos do not move. 
</I>

<LI>Will the cargos change their value throughout the game? or just hold the same value in one game?
<br><I>Cargos just hold the same value.  
</I>

<LI>do we need to pay attention to the island and icebergs if they are on the same square?
<br><I>Let the iceberg hide behind the island.  
</I>

<LI>Do we need to pay attention to the island and cargos if they are on the same square? Or just like the icebergs,the cargo can hide behind islands?
<br><I>The cargo hides behind the island. 
</I>

<LI>For volcanic islands, can they occupy the same square? I mean whether we have to check for overlapping during initialization of islands' positions.
<br><I>Yes, they can occupy the same square. No need to check for overlapping during initialization.
</I>

<LI>How about if icebergs , cargo, and Titanic occupy the same square ?
<br><I>The Titanic hits the iceberg and sinks. 
</I>

<LI>Do you expect or recommend us to do hw2 with arrays?
<br><I>We don't expect it, and we don't recommend it. It is probably easier to have different variables for each iceberg rather than using arrays. 
</I>

<LI>I can't run the initial prgram properly at my home computer. It seems that the program cannot clear the screen, it just shows the char(27)[2J but cannot clear the screen....
<br>Please tell me how I can run the inital program properly in my home computer, I think I have some problems in running and displaying the boundary of the sea and clearing the screen.
<br><I>Add the following line at the end of file C:\config.sys:   
<br>DEVICE=C:\Windows\Command\ANSI.SYS
<br>You may have to change it a little if your windows directory is different.
<br>If this does not help, we recommend commenting out the call to clear_screen() and home(). The screen will then scroll instead of redrawing in-place, but it will work otherwise. This will allow you to test it at home, but make sure to take out the comments before you hand it in.

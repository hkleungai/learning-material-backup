COMP 102: Computer & Programming Fundamentals I
LAB 4:  Highest Card

In this lab you will program a simple card game. This game uses 
a special deck of cards with all the same suit, and one of each 
kind of card. Use the following card numbers:

	 cardNumber:	cardType:
		1	Ace
		2-10	2-10
		11	Jack
		12	Queen
		13	King

Your program will deal out a set of four cards to the user at 
random. For simplicity, assume each card is drawn one at a time, 
noted down, and then replaced before the next card is drawn. 
Use the library function rand() to select the cards at random 
(you'll need to #include <stdlib.h> and <time.h>):

	#include <iostream.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#include <time.h>

	void main()
	{
		...  		
  		srand(time(0));  // initialize random number generator
		...
		cardNumber = rand()%13 + 1;  // picks a random number between 1 and 13
		...
	}

The score for each hand is the highest card number:

	  Hand:		Score:
	A A A A		1
	A 2 3 4		4
	2 4 7 J		11

Display the cards drawn (use characters A, J, Q, K for Ace and 
face cards), and the score for each hand. For example:

	hand: J J A Q  score: 12

After each hand is scored and displayed, prompt the user if they 
want another hand by asking them to type 'C' or 'c' to continue, 
or any other key to quit. 

	hand: 9 2 3 Q  score: 12
	Press 'C' or 'c' to continue, or any other key to quit: c
	hand: 3 9 4 9  score: 9
	Press 'C' or 'c' to continue, or any other key to quit: c
	hand: 3 A K 6  score: 13
	Press 'C' or 'c' to continue, or any other key to quit: q

COMP 102: Computer & Programming Fundamentals I
LAB 2

You will write a C++ coin-changing program for lab2. First, ask the user for the amount in 
Hong Kong dollars, such as 26.30. Then find the minimum number of $10, $5, $2, $1, 50 cent, 
20 cent, and 10 cent coins to give in return. 

For example, if the input is 26.30, the output should be

10-dollar coin: 2
5-dollar coin: 1
2-dollar coin: 0
1-dollar coin: 1
50-cent coin: 0
20-cent coin: 1
10-cent coin: 1

Have your TA check off your working program if you finish before the end of the lab session, 
otherwise turn in a copy of your program on floppy disk.

Basic instructions in writing console applications using Visual C++ 5.0</H2>

<H3>
Start up Visual C++</H3>
Please note that you may need to install Visual C++ yourself in the CCST
barn before proceeding to the following steps.
<UL>
<LI>
Click the "Start" button on the bottom-left corner of the screen.</LI>

<LI>
Select "Programs" from the pop-up menu.</LI>

<LI>
Select "Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0" -- a submenu will pop-up.</LI>

<LI>
Select "Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0" from the submenu (Visual C++ will start
running).</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Open a new project</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Click "File" from the menu bar.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "New" from the "File" submenu.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Project" from the pop-up dialog box (probably it is the default
choice and is already selected).</LI>

<LI>
On the right side of the window, enter new location (e.g. "C:\Lab1").</LI>

<LI>
Above the location, type in the project name (e.g. "Lab1").</LI>

<LI>
On the left side of the window, choose "Win32 Console Application".</LI>

<LI>
Click the "OK" button.</LI>
</UL>
Then a new project workspace will be created. A new folder (directory)
will also be created to store your program (C:\Lab1 in this case). Remember
to copy your program from this directory to the floppy disk (A:) and delete
this folder (directory) before leaving the computer barn. Otherwise your
work may be lost or stolen by others.
<H3>
Add a new C++ source file into the project</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Click "Project" from the menu bar.</LI>

<LI>
Select "Add-to-Project" from the "Project" sub-menu.</LI>

<LI>
Select "New" from the "Add-to-Project" sub-menu.</LI>

<LI>
Select "C++ Source File".</LI>

<LI>
Give a name to the file (e.g. "lab1").</LI>

<LI>
Click the "OK" button.</LI>
</UL>
A new blank file will be created and a new window for that file will be
displayed. For example in this case, a blank "lab1.cpp" file will be created.
You can now type your program into this blank file. An example program
is as follows :
<PRE>#include &lt;iostream.h>

void main()
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World" &lt;&lt; endl;
}</PRE>
You may type the above program into that blank file as a test.
<H3>
Compile and run the program</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Click "Build" from the menu bar.</LI>

<LI>
Select option "Build XXX.exe" from the "build" submenu (XXX is the name
of the project). If you use "Lab1", then "Build Lab1.exe" will be shown.</LI>
</UL>
If there are any syntax errors in the program, during the building (compiling)
phase, error messages will be displayed inside a window located at the
bottom of the Visual C++ editing window. You should then debug and correct
the errors and build the program again before you&nbsp; proceed to the
following steps.
<UL>
<LI>
Click "Build" from the menu bar.</LI>

<LI>
Select option "Execute XXX.exe" from "Build" submenu (XXX is the name of
the project).</LI>
</UL>
A dos prompt window will be displayed, and your program will start running.
<H3>
Save your program</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Click "File" from the menu bar.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Save workspace" from the "File" submenu.</LI>
</UL>
Then your program will be saved.
<H3>
Copy your work onto a floppy disk using Windows Explorer</H3>
You may not be able to finish the work during the lab and need to continue
your work later. Therefore you need to save your .cpp program to a diskette.&nbsp;
Don't try to save the workspace to the floppy, there is not enough disk
space. Only save the .cpp source file. Next time you come to the lab, you
can create a new Lab1 project again, and add your .cpp to the project instead
of a new blank file.
<UL>
<LI>
Click "Start" button on the bottom-left corner of the screen.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Programs" from the pop-up menu.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Windows Explorer", which is probably the last item in the menu.</LI>
</UL>
Then Windows Explorer will start. You will find that the explorer window
divided into two halves. The left part shows the hierarchy of the file
system as Desktops, C:, A:, etc. The right part shows the contents of the
folder selected in the left window. For example, if "C:\Program Files"
is&nbsp; selected in the left part, then the right part will show the contents
of the folder "Program Files".
<UL>
<LI>
Find&nbsp; the file which you created. For example, "lab1.cpp" located
in "C:\Lab1"</LI>

<LI>
Move the cursor over the file icon.</LI>

<LI>
Click the "RIGHT" mouse button, then a menu will pop-up.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Copy" from that menu, then the menu will disappear.</LI>

<LI>
Find&nbsp; the new location that you want to store your program (e.g. the
floppy A:).</LI>

<LI>
Move cursor over that icon (e.g. A:)</LI>

<LI>
Click the "RIGHT" mouse button, then a menu will pop-up.</LI>

<LI>
Choose "Paste" from that menu, then the menu will disappear.</LI>
</UL>
Then a dialog box will pop-up and display the status of copying. After
that, your program will be copied into the target destination (e.g. A:).
You can use a similar procedure to copy&nbsp; your programs back from A:
to C:.

<H3> COMP2012H Makeup Final </H3>

We are collecting the available dates for the makeup exam.  I am
proposing either May 25th or May 26th, that is, this coming Saturday
or Sunday.  Some students may have a final on 25th though.  Here
are the responses I've got so far:

<p>
Kin Fung Chu: OK 26th, 8.30-11.30 final on 25th, prefer 26th <br><br>
Sili Wang: OK 26th or 25th<br><br>
Hei Law: OK 26th or 25th<br><br>
D Wang: OK 26th, 8.30-11.30 final on 25th<br><br>
John Tan: OK 26th, 12.30-15.30 final on 25th<br><br>
Mengwei Liu: OK 26th or 25th <br><br>

 and 12.30-15.30 on Saturday.  I should be
able to finish grading the final after the final in the same Sunday
afternoon and post the final scores (before I set off on Monday).

Jiaxin Ye: OK 26th, 8.30-11.30 final on 25th so 4.30-7.30 is still good for you (and you prefer it) if our makup exam is on 25th

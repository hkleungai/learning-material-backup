<h3>&quot;Cyber Security is Everywhere&quot; Graphic Design Contest</h3>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
The objective of the &quot;Cyber Security is Everywhere&quot; Graphic Design Contest is to promote the awareness of information security, adoption of security best practices in the community, and appeal to the public to be vigilant and thereby avoid fall into the trap of criminals. The graphic should demonstrate the security threats faced by the computer users and how they could protect their IT devices and information assets in their daily lives. Examples of protective measures include do not use online banking services on public computers or through public Wi-Fi, enable browser's built-in phishing and malware protection to prevent unusual pop-up screen for requesting credit card information, adopt two-factor authentication as far as possible when accessing web services or cloud services, beware of phishing e-mail to avoid incurring losses of money and goodwill, do not disclose sensitive or credit card information on social networking sites, install security software on the mobile device, etc.

<h1>Doxygen notes</h1>

<p>Marine CARPUAT, TA (COMP151, Spring 2006, Prof. Dekai WU, HKUST)</p>

<p>Make sure you always document your code properly... Not only for
COMP151 labs, but for every piece of code you write.</p>

<h4>Why document your code?</h4>

<p>Comment your code so that someone who has no idea what the code
does can understand it. And keep in mind that, one day, that someone
will be you!</p>

<h4>What are useful comments?</h4>

<p>Compare the 2 comments below:
<ul>
<li>Comment A:<br><tt>perimeter = a + b + c; //compute perimeter by summing the lengths of the sides.</tt></li>
<li>Comment B:<br><tt>perimeter = a + b + c; //compute the sum of a, b and c.</tt></li>
</ul>
Comment B is useless because it only repeats the code without adding
new information. In contrast, comment A provides useful information by
explaining the purpose of this particular line of code.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#styleguide">Javadoc
style guide</a> contains a good example of useful vs. useless API
description, and other comment writing style tips.</p>

<h4>Writing documentation with Doxygen</h4>

<p>Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, and other programming
languages, that automatically generates documentation in both html and
LaTeX format, for a set of source files that are documented in a
specific format.</p>

<p>Running Doxygen will not only give you a nicely formatted
documentation, it will also help keep your documentation complete and
consistent.</p>

<h5>4 simple steps</h5>

<p><ol>
<li>Document *ALL* your classes and functions using Doxygen style comments (
see examples below)</li>
<li>Generate a doxygen config file by typing <br><tt>doxygen -g
doxygen.config</tt><br> in the directory where your source files are.</li>
<li>Use pico to edit the doxygen.config file. For instance, you can change the project
name (e.g. call it "lab02"), the output directory (e.g. call it "doc"), and other parameters as you see fit.</li>
<li>run <tt>doxygen doxygen.config</tt></li>
</ol>

DONE! you can now open doc/html/index.html to browse the html
documentation for your code.</p>

<p>For a more detailed introduction, check out the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual.html">Doxygen manual</a></p>

<h5>Writing comments for Doxygen</h5>

<p>Here is an <a href="doxygen_example.txt">example</a> of the use of Doxygen comment blocks. A Doxygen documentation block is a C or C++ style comment block with some additional markings, so that Doxygen knows it is a piece of documentation that needs to end up in the generated documentation.</p>

<p>For more details, consult the Doxygen manual section on <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html">Documenting the code</a>.</p>

<h5>Some Doxygen tips</h5>

<p>If you want ALL your comments to appear in the generated Doxygen
documentation, including comments in the main function, comments for
private members, etc., you should set the following parameters in the
config file:

<tt>
<ul>
<li>EXTRACT_ALL            = YES</li>
<li>EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES</li>
<li>EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES</li>
<li>EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = YES</li>
<li>EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS  = YES</li>
</ul>
</tt>

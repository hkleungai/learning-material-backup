	<li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saturday, Sept 24, 2005.&nbsp; Due to a 
	communication error, the version of Assignment 4 distributed at the 
	tutorials was an earlier version of the assignment than the one on the web 
	site<a href="Tutorials/Ass4_v1.pdf"> here</a>.&nbsp; There are some minor 
	changes between the two, especially in question 1. Students submitting the 
	assignment may submit solutions to whichever version they prefer.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Wednesday, Sept 21, 2005.&nbsp; Another small 
	typo was found in Assignment 3, Q3.&nbsp; The words <b>
	<font color="#0000FF">horizontal</font></b> and <b><font color="#0000FF">vertical</font></b> had been swapped.&nbsp; This has now been fixed. The

	the first n squares.&nbsp; Answers to these questions can be found
	<a href="Tutorials/Sum_Squares.pdf">here</a>.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monday, Sept 12, 2005:&nbsp; Many students 
	have said that they can not download the assignment solutions when they are 
	off-campus.&nbsp; This protection is intentional.&nbsp; Many of the 
	assignments are questions from the textbook.&nbsp; If their solutions were 
	posted on the web, then professors in other universities would not be able 
	to ask the same questions.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; professors using textbook 
	questions on their assignments have been asked not to make their solutions 
	accessible to the entire web.<br>&nbsp;</font></li>
	<li><font face="Comic Sans MS">Monday, Sept 12, 2005: Supplementary review

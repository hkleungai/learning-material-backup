COMP111 Lecture Slides</H2></CENTER>
The slides used in the lectures are available for downloading and printing
here.

<P>
I would advise you <B>NOT to</B> print all the notes at one time.
First, you will use up all your paper quota for this month shortly.
Second, notes after part 5 are likely to be revised. If you come to
class, you will automatically know when we will cover a new topic.
At that time, you print the next set of notes.

'mpage' has some problem in printing the last 4 pages of this set of

page 1-16, but print the last 4 pages without using mpage.

<P><B>Warning</B>

<P>You may find these files useful BUT please note that it is expected
that
<UL>
<LI>
<I>you have your own personal copy of the recommended textbook</I></LI>

<LI>
<I>you attend and listen to every lecture and every lab</I>.</LI>
</UL>
The files listed can not and do not replace going to the lectures and owning
a copy of the book.

<P><B>Printing</B>

<P>To load these files, click on the blue coloured words. If the program
you are using (probably `Netscape') has been configured correctly, the
postscript previewer program will automatically start and the file will
be loaded into the program. Then, to print the file, click on the `Print'
option, which is on the `File' menu item.

<P>In order to save papers, you may compress several pages into one sheet
of paper. If you are using a Unix-based system, there is a command "mpage"
that allows you to do that. The required steps are:

<P>Step 1: save your postcript file

<P>Step 2: <B>mpage</B> -2 -<B>P</B>{printer name} {your postscript file}

<P>Note:

<P>Please replace {printer name}, inclusive of the curly brackets, by the
name of a postscript printer that you want to use. You should also replace
{your postscript file}, also inclusive of the curly brackets, by your actual
filename.

<P>The flag "-2" means compressing two pages into 1 page. If you want to
compress 4 pages into 1 page, the command should be:

<P>mpage -4 -P{printer name} {your postscript file}

<P>For a more detailed description of "mpage", please do a "<B>man mpage</B>"
command to consult the online manual.

<P>To determine what printers are available and where they are, please
do a "<B>man printers</B>" command.

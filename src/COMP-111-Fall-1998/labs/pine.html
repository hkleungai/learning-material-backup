on using the program.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.etc.bc.ca/help/faqs/tutorial.pine.html">Here</A>
is a one page summary of the Pine main screen display and all the Pine
options. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/help_desk/pine/pine_tutorial.html">Here</A>
is a very useful location for understanding the Pine menus. You can just
click on the options shown in the picture to get more information. </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/iss/unix/pine/pmod5.html">Here</A>
is another guide to using Pine, starting with composing an email. Although
it is written for another University, it has lots of clear pictures and
useful text. </P>

<P>You are required to create and send an email message to one of the TA's.
The Subject of your email will be `<I>Greetings</I>'
and the contents will be `<I>Hi there! Bye!</I>'. More guidance will be
given during the lab. </P>

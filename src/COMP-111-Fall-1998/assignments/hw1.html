<strong>COMP 111 Homework 1 <br>
Due: Oct 7, 1998, 5pm</strong>
</center>
<ol>
<li>
Assume that you have started ftp from your home directory
on <tt>csl3su7.cs.ust.hk</tt>. Show how to do the following in a single
FTP session:

<ol>
<li type=a>
transfer the file "/tmp/comp111" from your CS account to the directory
   "COMP111" under your home directory in your CCST account.
<br>
and then
<br>
<li>
transfer all the binary image files in "/pub/gif" from
   "ftp.cs.geeku.edu.au" using anonymous ftp to the directory "COMP111" under
   your home directory. Transfer all the files in one command
   non-interactively.
</ol>

Assuming all files and directories involved already exist.
<p>
Show everything that you would need to type, including (at least approximately)
the prompts that you would be given. You do not need to include the numerical
messages that ftp would print (e.g. "331 Password required...").
<p>

<li>
<tt>cspeter</tt>
has console logged on
<tt>csl2su4.cs.ust.hk</tt>, then he remote-logged on
<tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<p>
<tt>cspaul</tt> has console logged on
<tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<p>
<tt>cspeter</tt> has executed the following command on
<tt>csl2su4.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<br>
<tt>xhost +csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<p>
<tt>cspaul</tt> has executed the following command on csl2su5.cs.ust.hk

<br>
<tt>xhost +csl2su4.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<br>
(note that <tt>cspaul</tt> and <tt>cspeter</tt> are login names)

<ol>
<li type=a> If <tt>cspeter</tt> wants all the display of his X applications,
executed on <tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>,
to be displayed on the console of <tt>csl2su4.cs.ust.hk</tt>, 
<ol>
	<li type=i>	which single command should he execute?
	<li>	where should he execute the above command?
</ol>

<li> If <tt>cspeter</tt> wants to display an xterm on the console of <tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>,

<ol>
	<li type=i>	which single command should he execute?
	<li>	where should he execute the above command?
</ol>

<li> If <tt>cspaul</tt> wants to display an xterm on the console of <tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>,

<ol>
	<li type=i>	which single command should he execute?
	<li>	where should he execute the above command?
</ol>

<li> If <tt>cspeter</tt> wants to stop the display from <tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>,

<ol>
	<li type=i>	which single command should he execute?
	<li>	where should he execute the above command?
</ol>

<li> Assuming <tt>cspeter</tt> has executed the command on part d), and now
   he wants to allow only the display of the X-applications, that
   was executed by him on <tt>csl2su5.cs.ust.hk</tt>, to be displayed on
   the console of <tt>csl2su4.cs.ust.hk</tt>

<ol>
	<li type=i>	which single command should he execute?
	<li>	where should he execute the above command?
</ol>
</ol>

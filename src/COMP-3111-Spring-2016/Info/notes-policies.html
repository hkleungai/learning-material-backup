   <LI><B>Instructional Approach</B><BR />
     <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>In
this course, you will learn both by <u>listening</u> (in the
lectures) and by <u>doing</u> (in the tutorials,
labs and project); both are important.  </I></B></FONT>The lectures will be used to cover the basic concepts and techniques of software engineering. The tutorials and labs will be used to allow you to apply the concepts and techniques to the development of a software product using industry standard software development tools.<BR />
   <BR />
   </LI>

   <LI><B>Expected Work
   Load</B><BR />
   This course may take up <u>quite a lot</u> of your time this semester since project-oriented software engineering courses
   are usually the <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>heaviest workload
   courses</I></B></FONT> in both graduate and undergraduate
   curricula. <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>However, prior planning and good time
   management can greatly mitigate your workload.</I></B></FONT><I><BR />
   <BR />
  </I></LI>

   <LI><A HREF="../Notes/lecture-notes.html" target="_blank"><B>Lecture
   Notes</B></A><BR />
   The lecture notes are available from the course website on Canvas.<FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I> Lecture notes are
   outlines only of the lecture material</I></B></FONT><I>.</I> They
   are not a substitute for  attending lectures.<BR />
   <BR />
   </LI>

   <LI><A HREF="../Project/project-info.html" target="_blank"><B>Course Project</B></A><BR />
     The course project is both an individual and a team project. For the team part of the project, you will form your own teams from students enrolled in the course. However, the instructor reserves the right to remove members from or to add members to a team so as to more evenly balance the number of people in each team.<br>
     <br>
     A project activity is due by the due date and time specified for the activity. <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>Late submissions will not be
   accepted.<br>
   <br>
     </I></B></FONT>This will probably be the first time that you
   will  produce a <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>software
   product</I></B></FONT> rather than simply a program. The greatest challenge you will face, and the greatest benefit derived, will be from the experience both of working in a team and of producing the required project artifacts (i.e., documentation, code and test cases) according to a strict schedule.<BR />
   <BR />
   </LI>

   <LI><A HREF="../Tutorials-Labs/tutorial-lab-schedule.html" target="_blank"><B>Tutorials/Labs</B></A><BR />
     The tutorials will be used primarily to introduce you to various software tools that you will need to do the project
     (i.e., <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio</A>, <A HREF="http://asp.net/" TARGET="_blank">ASP.NET</A>, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/editions/2012-editions/express.aspx" TARGET="_blank">SQL Server</A>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git,</a> <a href="http://www.nunit.org/" target="_blank">Nunit,</a> and <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ratimode" target="_blank">Rational  Modeler</a>).<br>
           <br>
     The labs will be used to work on the project and to do formal testing of your software. <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>Doing
       the  lab activities will form part of your final
       grade for the course.</I></B></FONT><br>
     <br>
     When not used
for specific instruction or activities, the tutorials and labs   are also a
time during which you can work  on the project or consult
with a TA about the project or other course material.<BR />
     <BR />

   <LI><A HREF="http://tl.ust.hk/integrity/student-1.html" TARGET="_blank"><B>Academic
   Integrity</B></A><BR />
   Unless otherwise stated, <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>the work that
   you submit for grading must represent the result of independent
   effort</I></B></FONT>. In particular, you are not allowed to give solutions to
    or to copy solutions from other
   individuals/teams. Suspected breaches of this rule will be
   referred to the relevant university authorities for disciplinary
   action. If in doubt, consult with the instructor or a TA
   first.<BR />

   <LI><B>Classroom Etiquette</B><BR />
   The following rules are for everyone's benefit  to ensure that the
   classroom environment is conducive to teaching and learning.

     <UL>
      <LI>You are expected to <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>arrive on
      time for lectures</I></B></FONT> (as is the instructor
      <IMG SRC="../images/smile.gif" WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 ALIGN=bottom />)
      and generally not to leave during the lecture unless an
      emergency arises. If you must leave during a lecture, please do
      so <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>as discretely and quietly as
      possible</I></B></FONT> so as to give
      <FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I>minimum disruption to the
      class</I></B></FONT>.</LI>

      <LI><FONT COLOR="#CC3300"><B><I><U>Talking is strictly
      prohibited during the lecture</U></I></B></FONT> unless  the instructor
      asks you a question or directs you to discuss
      something amongst yourselves. To behave otherwise shows
      disrespect, not only for the instructor, but more importantly
      for your fellow students.</LI>
   </UL>

   <DL>
      <DT>Please be considerate in your behavior and consider the
      possible effects of your actions on others <I><U>before</U></I>
      acting.<BR />
      <BR />
      </DT>
   </DL>
   </LI>

   <LI><B>Course Web Pages</B><BR />
   The course web pages are constantly undergoing
   revision. No information on the course web pages is final until it
   has been announced or confirmed in a lecture.<BR />

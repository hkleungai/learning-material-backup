<H4>OVERVIEW</H4>

<P>Software engineering is mainly concerned with following a <em>disciplined approach to software development </em>while making use of appropriate <em>software development tools and techniques</em>. This course introduces the topic through lectures and by giving you a chance to participate in the design, implementation and management of a software development project using industry standard software development tools. Since modeling is an important first step in developing a software system, we first consider how to model software systems using the <a href="http://www.uml.org/" target="_blank">Unified Modeling Language (UML)</a>. We then survey and critique various software development processes and focus on software development using SCRUM, an agile software development process. Next, using the Unified Process (UP) life cycle as a framework, we delve in-depth into the major engineering activities of the software development life cycle&#8212;requirements capture, analysis and design, implementation and testing&#8212;and show how the UML can be used for <em>modeling and documenting</em> a software system. We conclude with an overview of the major management activities of the software development life cycle&#8212;software quality assurance and project management.</P>

<H4>OBJECTIVES</H4>

<P>This course aims to give students both a theoretical and a practical foundation in the concepts and practices of software engineering. In the theoretical part, students will learn about the <em>principles</em> and <em>methods</em> of current software engineering practices focusing on the use of the UML in modeling software systems. In the practical part, students will become familiar with the disciplined development of a software product under a strict schedule using industry standard tools. After completing the course, students will have acquired the following.</P>

<UL>
   <LI>An understanding of the concepts as well as practices of
   software engineering.</LI>
   <LI>Experience with analyzing,
   designing, implementing and testing a software system.</LI>
   
   <LI>Hands-on experience with  an industry standard integrated development
   environment (IDE).</LI>
</UL>

<H4>SOME QUESTIONS THE COURSE WILL TRY TO ANSWER</H4>

How can we capture and document what the client would like the system to
do?<br />
How can we transform the client's requirements into a software
system?<br />
How can we build confidence that the system is implemented correctly and behaves as
desired?<br />
How do we organize the development project so that we meet our budget constraints and deliver a system on time?

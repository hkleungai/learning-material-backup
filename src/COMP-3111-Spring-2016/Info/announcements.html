    <p><b>Requirement 1 &#8211; Account application</b></p>
    <blockquote>Besides what you have already completed in the lab       homework, it is also expected that the web form to enter client       information is functional, that is, that one can actually input       and store the client information in the database. If you have       completed all the homework for Labs 2, 4 and 5, then all that       remains is to actually write the SQL statements that will insert       the data entered into the Account Application web page into your       database when a button is clicked on the web page. You are       expected to complete this requirement for Activity 1.</blockquote>
    <b>Requirement 2 &#8211; Client login accounts</b><br>
<blockquote>The requirement to be able to create client login       accounts was completed in Lab 5.<br>
  The requirement to be able to update the client information is       REMOVED as a requirement for Activity 1 and will not be tested.</blockquote>
<b>Requirement 3 &#8211; Securities browsing and searching</b><br>
<blockquote>This requirement is REMOVED as a requirement for       Activity 1 and will not be tested. (It is actually quite easy to       implement using the functions provided by the external systems.)</blockquote>
<b>Requirement 5(b) &#8211; Client support tools: Currency conversion</b><br>
<blockquote>This requirement for report 6(b) was completed in the       homework for Lab 3 and is all that is required for Activity 1.</blockquote>
<b>Requirement 6(b) &#8211; Report generation</b><br>

    <TD VALIGN=top><p class="style7"><strong>Accessing your web application folder on the M drive from the Virtual Desktop</strong></p>
    <p>As the Virtual Desktop is not hosted on the CSE department servers (it is hosted on ITSC servers), it is not possible to access the M drive directly from the Virtual Desktop. You have two options for accessing your web application if you have saved it to the M drive.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>DO NOT save your web application to the M drive.</strong><br>
        Instead, save it to a USB drive. You can then upload your web application onto the Virtual Desktop from your USB drive.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Use SFTP to access your web application folder on the M drive.</strong><br>
        From the Virtual Desktop, login to one of the Lab 2 Unix computers (i.e., csl2wk01.cse.ust.hk to csl2wk41.cse.ust.hk) using SFTP and then upload your web application folder from the ~/DOS folder on the Unix computer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The SFTP program to use on the Virtual Desktop is &quot;FileZilla&quot;, which can be found in the folder &quot;FileZilla FTP Client&quot; in &quot;All Programs&quot; in the Start menu.</p>
    <p><strong class="style7">NOTE:</strong> You need to enter &quot;sftp://csl2wk??.cse.ust.hk&quot; in the &quot;Host:&quot; field where you replace ?? by a number ranging from 01 to 41.</p></TD>

    <TD VALIGN=top><p class="style7"><strong>The Virtual Desktop &quot;Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise&quot; is now available for you to use.</strong></p>
      <p>To access the Virtual Desktop,  please log on with your ITSC network account to the Domain &quot;HKUST&quot; using the VMWare Horizon View client program. Once logged in, select the &quot;Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise&quot; Virtual Desktop.</p>
      <p>More details of how to get and use VMWare Horizon Client and connect to the Virtual Desktop can be found at the following links.</p>

    <TD VALIGN=top>12/02/16</TD>
    <TD VALIGN=top>Since the latest version of Visual Studio Community Edition supports all  the features that will be used in the course project (see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/compare-visual-studio-2015-products-vs.aspx">https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/compare-visual-studio-2015-products-vs.aspx</a>), it is OK to use it on your computers to develop your web application.<br>
      <br>
For the database system, you need to use SQL Server Express version  12.0.2000.8 so that it is compatible with the version used in Lab 4.  This is <strong class="style7">VERY IMPORTANT</strong> as there have been issues in past offerings of the course with students using an incompatible version of SQL Server Express.<br>
<br>
Please note that regardless of where you develop your web application,  it is a requirement of the course project that your web application run  on the computers in Lab 4 as that is the environment in which all the  testing will be performed. Therefore, <em class="style7"><strong>you must ensure that your web application will run without errors on the computers in Lab 4.</strong></em> If it does not, then it is highly likely that you will lose marks when your web application is tested by us.</TD>

<p>COMP572 -- Fall 2004</p>
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Project FAQ</font></h2>
<h2><font size="3">This page maintains answers to questions asked by students 
concerning the <a href="index.htm">COMP572 project</a>. </font></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><ul>
  <li>
<h2><font size="3">General Questions</font></h2>  <ul>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: Can I use tool XXXX&nbsp; (not available on 
    your machines) to build my&nbsp; GUI?</font><br>
    A: Yes, as long as there is some way that we can <i>test</i> your executable 
    code on either our Windows PC or Solaris machines. That is,&nbsp; you should 
    be able to send us working object code or set up a URL where we can test 
    your GUI on your own server.&nbsp; What wouldn't be allowable, though, is 
    implementing your code in such a way that it could only be run on your own 
    notebook that would have to be brought into our offices.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: I did very poorly on Homework 1.&nbsp; Can I 
    make up for this by doing extra work on the project?<br>
    </font>A: Yes.&nbsp; If you want to do this you should sign up as an 
    individual for project 2A, 3A or 4A but,&nbsp; when it comes time to hand in 
    the project,&nbsp; you should hand in as much of 2B, 3B or 4B that you can 
    do. A couple of comments.&nbsp;  <ul>
    <li>(i)&nbsp; I am permitting this because I was asked by a few students&nbsp; 
    who wanted to make up for poor performance&nbsp; but I do not recommend 
    doing this unless you received below a 65 on the first homework..&nbsp; If 
    you received a 65 on the first homework but did well on the other two and 
    the project it is still possible to get a B+ in the class.</li>
    <li>(ii) Your&nbsp; class grade will depend only upon <b>your</b> 
    performance and not on that of the rest of the class. This means that if you 
    are currently doing well in the class you do not have to worry that some 
    other students will raise their grades by doing extra work on the project 
    and this&nbsp; will lower <b>your</b> grade.&nbsp; I mention this because 
    there is always some misunderstanding on this point by students who 
    incorrectly believe that the class is being marked on a &quot;curve&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
    </li>
    <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: Does my code have to be robust to input, e.g., 
    , does it have to check if the input data is in proper format, etc?</font><br>
    A: No. Your code may assume that input data is in the specified format.&nbsp; 
    It must run properly on correct data but its performance on unformatted 
    input doesn't matter.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><font size="3"><a href="Simplex.html">Simplex</a></font></h2><ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: How should I handle LPs with infeasible or 
  unbounded solutions?</font><br>
  A:&nbsp; You need to report these situations.&nbsp; this was missing from the 
  original specs but has now been added.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: How should I handle LPs with redundant 
  constraints?</font><br>
  A:&nbsp; You do <b>not</b> need to explicitly report finding redundant 
  constraints but you should be aware that your program needs to implicitly 
  handle this case in Phase I by throwing away redundant constraints.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: Should I worry about <b>cycling</b>?</font><br>
  A:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; It is highly recommended that you use Bland's anti-cycling&nbsp; 
  rule given in the slides (or any other anti-cycling rule that you might find).&nbsp; 
  In your documentation you should explicitly state which anti-cycling rule you 
  are using.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#FF0000">Q: Are the variables to the problem constrained or 
  unconstrained?</font><br>
  A:&nbsp; This was omitted in the original specifications. The variables should 
  always be constrained.&nbsp; That is,&nbsp; you should assume that all 
  variables x_i satisfy x_i &gt;=0.</li>
